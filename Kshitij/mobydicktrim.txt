chapter 1 
loomings call me ishmael 
some years ago never mind how long precisely having little or no money in my purse  and nothing particular to interest me on shore  i thought i would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world 
it is a way i have of driving off the spleen andregulating the circulation 
whenever i find myself growing grim aboutthe mouth  whenever it is a damp  drizzly november in my soul  wheneveri find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses  andbringing up the rear of every funeral i meet  and especially whenevermy hypos get such an upper hand of me  that it requires a strong moralprinciple to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street  andmethodically knocking people s hats off then  i account it high time toget to sea as soon as i can 
this is my substitute for pistol and ball with a philosophical flourish cato throws himself upon his sword  iquietly take to the ship 
there is nothing surprising in this 
if theybut knew it  almost all men in their degree  some time or other cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me there now is your insular city of the manhattoes  belted round bywharves as indian isles by coral reefs commerce surrounds it with hersurf 
right and left  the streets take you waterward 
its extremedowntown is the battery  where that noble mole is washed by waves  andcooled by breezes  which a few hours previous were out of sight ofland 
look at the crowds of water gazers there circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon 
go from corlearshook to coenties slip  and from thence  by whitehall  northward 
whatdo you see  posted like silent sentinels all around the town  standthousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries 
someleaning against the spiles  some seated upon the pier heads  somelooking over the bulwarks of ships from china  some high aloft in therigging  as if striving to get a still better seaward peep 
but theseare all landsmen  of week days pent up in lath and plaster tied tocounters  nailed to benches  clinched to desks 
how then is this 
arethe green fields gone 
what do they here but look 
here come more crowds  pacing straight for the water  andseemingly bound for a dive 
nothing will content them but theextremest limit of the land  loitering under the shady lee of yonderwarehouses will not suffice 
they must get just as nigh the wateras they possibly can without falling in 
and there they stand miles ofthem leagues 
inlanders all  they come from lanes and alleys  streetsand avenues north  east  south  and west 
yet here they all unite 
tellme  does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of allthose ships attract them thither once more 
say you are in the country  in some high land of lakes 
takealmost any path you please  and ten to one it carries you down in adale  and leaves you there by a pool in the stream 
there is magic init 
let the most absent minded of men be plunged in his deepestreveries stand that man on his legs  set his feet a going  and he willinfallibly lead you to water  if water there be in all that region should you ever be athirst in the great american desert  try thisexperiment  if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysicalprofessor 
yes  as every one knows  meditation and water are wedded forever but here is an artist 
he desires to paint you the dreamiest  shadiest quietest  most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valleyof the saco 
what is the chief element he employs 
there stand histrees  each with a hollow trunk  as if a hermit and a crucifix werewithin  and here sleeps his meadow  and there sleep his cattle  and upfrom yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke 
deep into distant woodlandswinds a mazy way  reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed intheir hill side blue 
but though the picture lies thus tranced  andthough this pine tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon thisshepherd s head  yet all were vain  unless the shepherd s eye werefixed upon the magic stream before him 
go visit the prairies in june when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee deep amongtiger lilies what is the one charm wanting  water there is not a dropof water there 
were niagara but a cataract of sand  would you travelyour thousand miles to see it 
why did the poor poet of tennessee  uponsuddenly receiving two handfuls of silver  deliberate whether to buyhim a coat  which he sadly needed  or invest his money in a pedestriantrip to rockaway beach 
why is almost every robust healthy boy with arobust healthy soul in him  at some time or other crazy to go to sea why upon your first voyage as a passenger  did you yourself feel such amystical vibration  when first told that you and your ship were now outof sight of land 
why did the old persians hold the sea holy 
why didthe greeks give it a separate deity  and own brother of jove 
surelyall this is not without meaning 
and still deeper the meaning of thatstory of narcissus  who because he could not grasp the tormenting  mildimage he saw in the fountain  plunged into it and was drowned 
but thatsame image  we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans 
it is the imageof the ungraspable phantom of life  and this is the key to it all now  when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i beginto grow hazy about the eyes  and begin to be over conscious of mylungs  i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as apassenger 
for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse  and apurse is but a rag unless you have something in it 
besides  passengersget sea sick grow quarrelsome don t sleep of nights do not enjoythemselves much  as a general thing  no  i never go as a passenger nor  though i am something of a salt  do i ever go to sea as acommodore  or a captain  or a cook 
i abandon the glory and distinctionof such offices to those who like them 
for my part  i abominate allhonorable respectable toils  trials  and tribulations of every kindwhatsoever 
it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself without taking care of ships  barques  brigs  schooners  and what not and as for going as cook  though i confess there is considerable gloryin that  a cook being a sort of officer on ship board yet  somehow  inever fancied broiling fowls  though once broiled  judiciouslybuttered  and judgmatically salted and peppered  there is no one whowill speak more respectfully  not to say reverentially  of a broiledfowl than i will 
it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the oldegyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse  that you see themummies of those creatures in their huge bake houses the pyramids no  when i go to sea  i go as a simple sailor  right before the mast plumb down into the forecastle  aloft there to the royal mast head true  they rather order me about some  and make me jump from spar tospar  like a grasshopper in a may meadow 
and at first  this sort ofthing is unpleasant enough 
it touches one s sense of honor particularly if you come of an old established family in the land  thevan rensselaers  or randolphs  or hardicanutes 
and more than all  ifjust previous to putting your hand into the tar pot  you have beenlording it as a country schoolmaster  making the tallest boys stand inawe of you 
the transition is a keen one  i assure you  from aschoolmaster to a sailor  and requires a strong decoction of seneca andthe stoics to enable you to grin and bear it 
but even this wears offin time what of it  if some old hunks of a sea captain orders me to get a broomand sweep down the decks 
what does that indignity amount to  weighed i mean  in the scales of the new testament 
do you think the archangelgabriel thinks anything the less of me  because i promptly andrespectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance 
who ain ta slave 
tell me that 
well  then  however the old sea captains mayorder me about however they may thump and punch me about  i have thesatisfaction of knowing that it is all right  that everybody else isone way or other served in much the same way either in a physical ormetaphysical point of view  that is  and so the universal thump ispassed round  and all hands should rub each other s shoulder blades and be content again  i always go to sea as a sailor  because they make a point ofpaying me for my trouble  whereas they never pay passengers a singlepenny that i ever heard of 
on the contrary  passengers themselves mustpay 
and there is all the difference in the world between paying andbeing paid 
the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortableinfliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us 
but beingpaid  what will compare with it 
the urbane activity with which a manreceives money is really marvellous  considering that we so earnestlybelieve money to be the root of all earthly ills  and that on noaccount can a monied man enter heaven 
how cheerfully we consignourselves to perdition finally  i always go to sea as a sailor  because of the wholesomeexercise and pure air of the fore castle deck 
for as in this world head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern  that is  ifyou never violate the pythagorean maxim   so for the most part thecommodore on the quarter deck gets his atmosphere at second hand fromthe sailors on the forecastle 
he thinks he breathes it first  but notso 
in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in manyother things  at the same time that the leaders little suspect it 
butwherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as amerchant sailor  i should now take it into my head to go on a whalingvoyage  this the invisible police officer of the fates  who has theconstant surveillance of me  and secretly dogs me  and influences me insome unaccountable way he can better answer than any one else 
and doubtless  my going on this whaling voyage  formed part of the grandprogramme of providence that was drawn up a long time ago 
it came inas a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensiveperformances 
i take it that this part of the bill must have runsomething like this  grand contested election for the presidency of the united states  whaling voyage by one ishmael 
 bloody battle in affghanistan  though i cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers  thefates  put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage  whenothers were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies  and shortand easy parts in genteel comedies  and jolly parts in farces though icannot tell why this was exactly  yet  now that i recall all thecircumstances  i think i can see a little into the springs and motiveswhich being cunningly presented to me under various disguises  inducedme to set about performing the part i did  besides cajoling me into thedelusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewilland discriminating judgment chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whalehimself 
such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all mycuriosity 
then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his islandbulk  the undeliverable  nameless perils of the whale  these  with allthe attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds helped to sway me to my wish 
with other men  perhaps  such thingswould not have been inducements  but as for me  i am tormented with aneverlasting itch for things remote 
i love to sail forbidden seas  andland on barbarous coasts 
not ignoring what is good  i am quick toperceive a horror  and could still be social with it would they letme since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates ofthe place one lodges in by reason of these things  then  the whaling voyage was welcome  thegreat flood gates of the wonder world swung open  and in the wildconceits that swayed me to my purpose  two and two there floated intomy inmost soul  endless processions of the whale  and  mid most of themall  one grand hooded phantom  like a snow hill in the air chapter 2 
the carpet bag i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet bag  tucked it under myarm  and started for cape horn and the pacific 
quitting the good cityof old manhatto  i duly arrived in new bedford 
it was a saturday nightin december 
much was i disappointed upon learning that the littlepacket for nantucket had already sailed  and that no way of reachingthat place would offer  till the following monday as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop atthis same new bedford  thence to embark on their voyage  it may as wellbe related that i  for one  had no idea of so doing 
for my mind wasmade up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft  because there was afine  boisterous something about everything connected with that famousold island  which amazingly pleased me 
besides though new bedford hasof late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling  and thoughin this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her  yet nantucketwas her great original the tyre of this carthage  the place where thefirst dead american whale was stranded 
where else but from nantucketdid those aboriginal whalemen  the red men  first sally out in canoesto give chase to the leviathan 
and where but from nantucket  too  didthat first adventurous little sloop put forth  partly laden withimported cobblestones so goes the story to throw at the whales  inorder to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from thebowsprit now having a night  a day  and still another night following before mein new bedford  ere i could embark for my destined port  it became amatter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile 
it was avery dubious looking  nay  a very dark and dismal night  bitingly coldand cheerless 
i knew no one in the place 
with anxious grapnels i hadsounded my pocket  and only brought up a few pieces of silver  so wherever you go  ishmael  said i to myself  as i stood in the middle ofa dreary street shouldering my bag  and comparing the gloom towards thenorth with the darkness towards the south wherever in your wisdom youmay conclude to lodge for the night  my dear ishmael  be sure toinquire the price  and don t be too particular with halting steps i paced the streets  and passed the sign of  thecrossed harpoons  but it looked too expensive and jolly there 
furtheron  from the bright red windows of the  sword fish inn   there camesuch fervent rays  that it seemed to have melted the packed snow andice from before the house  for everywhere else the congealed frost layten inches thick in a hard  asphaltic pavement  rather weary for me when i struck my foot against the flinty projections  because fromhard  remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a mostmiserable plight 
too expensive and jolly  again thought i  pausing onemoment to watch the broad glare in the street  and hear the sounds ofthe tinkling glasses within 
but go on  ishmael  said i at last  don tyou hear 
get away from before the door  your patched boots arestopping the way 
so on i went 
i now by instinct followed the streetsthat took me waterward  for there  doubtless  were the cheapest  if notthe cheeriest inns such dreary streets 
blocks of blackness  not houses  on either hand and here and there a candle  like a candle moving about in a tomb 
atthis hour of the night  of the last day of the week  that quarter ofthe town proved all but deserted 
but presently i came to a smoky lightproceeding from a low  wide building  the door of which stoodinvitingly open 
it had a careless look  as if it were meant for theuses of the public  so  entering  the first thing i did was to stumbleover an ash box in the porch 
thought i  ha  as the flyingparticles almost choked me  are these ashes from that destroyed city gomorrah 
but  the crossed harpoons   and  the sword fish   this  thenmust needs be the sign of  the trap   however  i picked myself up andhearing a loud voice within  pushed on and opened a second  interiordoor it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet 
a hundred blackfaces turned round in their rows to peer  and beyond  a black angel ofdoom was beating a book in a pulpit 
it was a negro church  and thepreacher s text was about the blackness of darkness  and the weepingand wailing and teeth gnashing there 
ha  ishmael  muttered i  backingout  wretched entertainment at the sign of  the trap  moving on  i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from thedocks  and heard a forlorn creaking in the air  and looking up  saw aswinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it  faintlyrepresenting a tall straight jet of misty spray  and these wordsunderneath  the spouter inn  peter coffin  coffin  spouter  rather ominous in that particular connexion  thoughti 
but it is a common name in nantucket  they say  and i suppose thispeter here is an emigrant from there 
as the light looked so dim  andthe place  for the time  looked quiet enough  and the dilapidatedlittle wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted herefrom the ruins of some burnt district  and as the swinging sign had apoverty stricken sort of creak to it  i thought that here was the veryspot for cheap lodgings  and the best of pea coffee it was a queer sort of place a gable ended old house  one side palsiedas it were  and leaning over sadly 
it stood on a sharp bleak corner where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling thanever it did about poor paul s tossed craft 
euroclydon  nevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in doors  with his feet on thehob quietly toasting for bed 
 in judging of that tempestuous windcalled euroclydon   says an old writer of whose works i possess theonly copy extant  it maketh a marvellous difference  whether thoulookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on theoutside  or whether thou observest it from that sashless window  wherethe frost is on both sides  and of which the wight death is the onlyglazier   true enough  thought i  as this passage occurred to mymind old black letter  thou reasonest well 
yes  these eyes arewindows  and this body of mine is the house 
what a pity they didn tstop up the chinks and the crannies though  and thrust in a little linthere and there 
but it s too late to make any improvements now 
theuniverse is finished  the copestone is on  and the chips were cartedoff a million years ago 
poor lazarus there  chattering his teethagainst the curbstone for his pillow  and shaking off his tatters withhis shiverings  he might plug up both ears with rags  and put acorn cob into his mouth  and yet that would not keep out thetempestuous euroclydon 
says old dives  in his red silkenwrapper  he had a redder one afterwards  pooh  pooh 
what a fine frostynight  how orion glitters  what northern lights 
let them talk of theiroriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories  give me theprivilege of making my own summer with my own coals but what thinks lazarus 
can he warm his blue hands by holding them upto the grand northern lights 
would not lazarus rather be in sumatrathan here 
would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along theline of the equator  yea  ye gods 
go down to the fiery pit itself  inorder to keep out this frost now  that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before thedoor of dives  this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should bemoored to one of the moluccas 
yet dives himself  he too lives like aczar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs  and being a president of atemperance society  he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans but no more of this blubbering now  we are going a whaling  and thereis plenty of that yet to come 
let us scrape the ice from our frostedfeet  and see what sort of a place this  spouter  may be chapter 3 
the spouter inn entering that gable ended spouter inn  you found yourself in a wide low  straggling entry with old fashioned wainscots  reminding one ofthe bulwarks of some condemned old craft 
on one side hung a very largeoilpainting so thoroughly besmoked  and every way defaced  that in theunequal crosslights by which you viewed it  it was only by diligentstudy and a series of systematic visits to it  and careful inquiry ofthe neighbors  that you could any way arrive at an understanding of itspurpose 
such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows  that at firstyou almost thought some ambitious young artist  in the time of the newengland hags  had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched 
but by dintof much and earnest contemplation  and oft repeated ponderings  andespecially by throwing open the little window towards the back of theentry  you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea  howeverwild  might not be altogether unwarranted but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long  limber portentous  black mass of something hovering in the centre of thepicture over three blue  dim  perpendicular lines floating in anameless yeast 
a boggy  soggy  squitchy picture truly  enough to drivea nervous man distracted 
yet was there a sort of indefinite half attained  unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you toit  till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out whatthat marvellous painting meant 
ever and anon a bright  but  alas deceptive idea would dart you through  it s the black sea in a midnightgale  it s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements  it s ablasted heath  it s a hyperborean winter scene  it s the breaking up ofthe icebound stream of time 
but at last all these fancies yielded tothat one portentous something in the picture s midst 
that once foundout  and all the rest were plain 
but stop  does it not bear a faintresemblance to a gigantic fish 
even the great leviathan himself in fact  the artist s design seemed this  a final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons withwhom i conversed upon the subject 
the picture represents a cape hornerin a great hurricane  the half foundered ship weltering there with itsthree dismantled masts alone visible  and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft  is in the enormous act ofimpaling himself upon the three mast heads the opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenisharray of monstrous clubs and spears 
some were thickly set withglittering teeth resembling ivory saws  others were tufted with knotsof human hair  and one was sickle shaped  with a vast handle sweepinground like the segment made in the new mown grass by a long armedmower 
you shuddered as you gazed  and wondered what monstrous cannibaland savage could ever have gone a death harvesting with such a hacking horrifying implement 
mixed with these were rusty old whaling lancesand harpoons all broken and deformed 
some were storied weapons 
withthis once long lance  now wildly elbowed  fifty years ago did nathanswain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset 
and thatharpoon so like a corkscrew now was flung in javan seas  and run awaywith by a whale  years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco 
theoriginal iron entered nigh the tail  and  like a restless needlesojourning in the body of a man  travelled full forty feet  and at lastwas found imbedded in the hump crossing this dusky entry  and on through yon low arched way cutthrough what in old times must have been a great central chimney withfireplaces all round you enter the public room 
a still duskier placeis this  with such low ponderous beams above  and such old wrinkledplanks beneath  that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft scockpits  especially of such a howling night  when this corner anchoredold ark rocked so furiously 
on one side stood a long  low  shelf liketable covered with cracked glass cases  filled with dusty raritiesgathered from this wide world s remotest nooks 
projecting from thefurther angle of the room stands a dark looking den the bar a rudeattempt at a right whale s head 
be that how it may  there stands thevast arched bone of the whale s jaw  so wide  a coach might almostdrive beneath it 
within are shabby shelves  ranged round with olddecanters  bottles  flasks  and in those jaws of swift destruction like another cursed jonah  by which name indeed they called him  bustles a little withered old man  who  for their money  dearly sellsthe sailors deliriums and death abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison 
though truecylinders without within  the villanous green goggling glassesdeceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom 
parallel meridiansrudely pecked into the glass  surround these footpads  goblets 
fill tothis mark  and your charge is but a penny  to this a penny more and so on to the full glass the cape horn measure  which you may gulpdown for a shilling upon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered abouta table  examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander 
isought the landlord  and telling him i desired to be accommodated witha room  received for answer that his house was full not a bedunoccupied 
 but avast   he added  tapping his forehead   you haint noobjections to sharing a harpooneer s blanket  have ye 
i s pose you aregoin  a whalin   so you d better get used to that sort of thing  i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed  that if i shouldever do so  it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be  and thatif he  the landlord  really had no other place for me  and theharpooneer was not decidedly objectionable  why rather than wanderfurther about a strange town on so bitter a night  i would put up withthe half of any decent man s blanket  i thought so 
all right  take a seat 
supper  you want supper supper ll be ready directly  i sat down on an old wooden settle  carved all over like a bench on thebattery 
at one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it withhis jack knife  stooping over and diligently working away at the spacebetween his legs 
he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail  buthe didn t make much headway  i thought at last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in anadjoining room 
it was cold as iceland no fire at all the landlord saidhe couldn t afford it 
nothing but two dismal tallow candles  each in awinding sheet 
we were fain to button up our monkey jackets  and holdto our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers 
but thefare was of the most substantial kind not only meat and potatoes  butdumplings  good heavens 
dumplings for supper 
one young fellow in agreen box coat  addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direfulmanner  my boy   said the landlord   you ll have the nightmare to a deadsartainty   landlord   i whispered   that aint the harpooneer is it   oh  no   said he  looking a sort of diabolically funny   theharpooneer is a dark complexioned chap 
he never eats dumplings  hedon t he eats nothing but steaks  and he likes  em rare   the devil he does   says i 
 where is that harpooneer 
is he here   he ll be here afore long   was the answer i could not help it  but i began to feel suspicious of this  darkcomplexioned  harpooneer 
at any rate  i made up my mind that if it soturned out that we should sleep together  he must undress and get intobed before i did supper over  the company went back to the bar room  when  knowing notwhat else to do with myself  i resolved to spend the rest of theevening as a looker on presently a rioting noise was heard without 
starting up  the landlordcried   that s the grampus s crew 
i seed her reported in the offingthis morning  a three years  voyage  and a full ship 
hurrah  boys  nowwe ll have the latest news from the feegees  a tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry  the door was flungopen  and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough 
enveloped in theirshaggy watch coats  and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters all bedarned and ragged  and their beards stiff with icicles  theyseemed an eruption of bears from labrador 
they had just landed fromtheir boat  and this was the first house they entered 
no wonder  then that they made a straight wake for the whale s mouth the bar when thewrinkled little old jonah  there officiating  soon poured them outbrimmers all round 
one complained of a bad cold in his head  uponwhich jonah mixed him a pitch like potion of gin and molasses  which heswore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever  nevermind of how long standing  or whether caught off the coast of labrador or on the weather side of an ice island the liquor soon mounted into their heads  as it generally does evenwith the arrantest topers newly landed from sea  and they begancapering about most obstreperously i observed  however  that one of them held somewhat aloof  and thoughhe seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by hisown sober face  yet upon the whole he refrained from making as muchnoise as the rest 
this man interested me at once  and since thesea gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate  thoughbut a sleeping partner one  so far as this narrative is concerned   iwill here venture upon a little description of him 
he stood full sixfeet in height  with noble shoulders  and a chest like a coffer dam 
ihave seldom seen such brawn in a man 
his face was deeply brown andburnt  making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast  while in thedeep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seemto give him much joy 
his voice at once announced that he was asoutherner  and from his fine stature  i thought he must be one ofthose tall mountaineers from the alleghanian ridge in virginia 
whenthe revelry of his companions had mounted to its height  this manslipped away unobserved  and i saw no more of him till he became mycomrade on the sea 
in a few minutes  however  he was missed by hisshipmates  and being  it seems  for some reason a huge favourite withthem  they raised a cry of  bulkington 
where sbulkington   and darted out of the house in pursuit of him it was now about nine o clock  and the room seeming almostsupernaturally quiet after these orgies  i began to congratulate myselfupon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to theentrance of the seamen no man prefers to sleep two in a bed 
in fact  you would a good dealrather not sleep with your own brother 
i don t know how it is  butpeople like to be private when they are sleeping 
and when it comes tosleeping with an unknown stranger  in a strange inn  in a strange town and that stranger a harpooneer  then your objections indefinitelymultiply 
nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor shouldsleep two in a bed  more than anybody else  for sailors no more sleeptwo in a bed at sea  than bachelor kings do ashore 
to be sure they allsleep together in one apartment  but you have your own hammock  andcover yourself with your own blanket  and sleep in your own skin the more i pondered over this harpooneer  the more i abominated thethought of sleeping with him 
it was fair to presume that being aharpooneer  his linen or woollen  as the case might be  would not be ofthe tidiest  certainly none of the finest 
i began to twitch all over besides  it was getting late  and my decent harpooneer ought to be homeand going bedwards 
suppose now  he should tumble in upon me atmidnight how could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming  landlord 
i ve changed my mind about that harpooneer  i shan t sleepwith him 
i ll try the bench here   just as you please  i m sorry i can t spare ye a tablecloth for amattress  and it s a plaguy rough board here  feeling of the knots andnotches 
 but wait a bit  skrimshander  i ve got a carpenter s planethere in the bar wait  i say  and i ll make ye snug enough   so sayinghe procured the plane  and with his old silk handkerchief first dustingthe bench  vigorously set to planing away at my bed  the while grinninglike an ape 
the shavings flew right and left  till at last theplane iron came bump against an indestructible knot 
the landlord wasnear spraining his wrist  and i told him for heaven s sake to quit thebed was soft enough to suit me  and i did not know how all the planingin the world could make eider down of a pine plank 
so gathering up theshavings with another grin  and throwing them into the great stove inthe middle of the room  he went about his business  and left me in abrown study i now took the measure of the bench  and found that it was a foot tooshort  but that could be mended with a chair 
but it was a foot toonarrow  and the other bench in the room was about four inches higherthan the planed one so there was no yoking them 
i then placed thefirst bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall leaving a little interval between  for my back to settle down in 
but isoon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me fromunder the sill of the window  that this plan would never do at all especially as another current from the rickety door met the one fromthe window  and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds inthe immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend thenight the devil fetch that harpooneer  thought i  but stop  couldn t i steala march on him bolt his door inside  and jump into his bed  not to bewakened by the most violent knockings 
it seemed no bad idea  but uponsecond thoughts i dismissed it 
for who could tell but what the nextmorning  so soon as i popped out of the room  the harpooneer might bestanding in the entry  all ready to knock me down still  looking round me again  and seeing no possible chance ofspending a sufferable night unless in some other person s bed  i beganto think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudicesagainst this unknown harpooneer 
thinks i  i ll wait awhile  he must bedropping in before long 
i ll have a good look at him then  and perhapswe may become jolly good bedfellows after all there s no telling but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones  twos  and threes and going to bed  yet no sign of my harpooneer  landlord   said i   what sort of a chap is he does he always keep suchlate hours   it was now hard upon twelve o clock the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle  and seemed to bemightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension 
 no   heanswered   generally he s an early bird airley to bed and airley torise yes  he s the bird what catches the worm 
but to night he went outa peddling  you see  and i don t see what on airth keeps him so late unless  may be  he can t sell his head   can t sell his head  what sort of a bamboozingly story is this you aretelling me   getting into a towering rage 
 do you pretend to say landlord  that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessedsaturday night  or rather sunday morning  in peddling his head aroundthis town   that s precisely it   said the landlord   and i told him he couldn tsell it here  the market s overstocked   with what   shouted i  with heads to be sure  ain t there too many heads in the world   i tell you what it is  landlord   said i quite calmly   you d betterstop spinning that yarn to me i m not green   may be not   taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick   but irayther guess you ll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you aslanderin  his head   i ll break it for him   said i  now flying into a passion again atthis unaccountable farrago of the landlord s  it s broke a ready   said he  broke   said i  broke  do you mean   sartain  and that s the very reason he can t sell it  i guess   landlord   said i  going up to him as cool as mt 
hecla in asnow storm  landlord  stop whittling 
you and i must understand oneanother  and that too without delay 
i come to your house and want abed  you tell me you can only give me half a one  that the other halfbelongs to a certain harpooneer 
and about this harpooneer  whom i havenot yet seen  you persist in telling me the most mystifying andexasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feelingtowards the man whom you design for my bedfellow a sort of connexion landlord  which is an intimate and confidential one in the highestdegree 
i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what thisharpooneer is  and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend thenight with him 
and in the first place  you will be so good as to unsaythat story about selling his head  which if true i take to be goodevidence that this harpooneer is stark mad  and i ve no idea ofsleeping with a madman  and you  sir  you i mean  landlord  you sir  by trying to induce me to do so knowingly  would thereby renderyourself liable to a criminal prosecution   wall   said the landlord  fetching a long breath   that s a purty longsarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then 
but be easy  beeasy  this here harpooneer i have been tellin  you of has just arrivedfrom the south seas  where he bought up a lot of  balmed new zealandheads  great curios  you know   and he s sold all on  em but one  andthat one he s trying to sell to night  cause to morrow s sunday  and itwould not do to be sellin  human heads about the streets when folks isgoin  to churches 
he wanted to  last sunday  but i stopped him just ashe was goin  out of the door with four heads strung on a string  forall the airth like a string of inions  this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery  and showedthat the landlord  after all  had had no idea of fooling me but at thesame time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of asaturday night clean into the holy sabbath  engaged in such a cannibalbusiness as selling the heads of dead idolators  depend upon it  landlord  that harpooneer is a dangerous man   he pays reg lar   was the rejoinder 
 but come  it s getting dreadfullate  you had better be turning flukes it s a nice bed  sal and meslept in that ere bed the night we were spliced 
there s plenty of roomfor two to kick about in that bed  it s an almighty big bed that 
why afore we give it up  sal used to put our sam and little johnny in thefoot of it 
but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night  andsomehow  sam got pitched on the floor  and came near breaking his arm arter that  sal said it wouldn t do 
come along here  i ll give ye aglim in a jiffy   and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towardsme  offering to lead the way 
but i stood irresolute  when looking at aclock in the corner  he exclaimed  i vum it s sunday you won t see thatharpooneer to night  he s come to anchor somewhere come along then do come  won t ye come  i considered the matter a moment  and then up stairs we went  and i wasushered into a small room  cold as a clam  and furnished  sure enough with a prodigious bed  almost big enough indeed for any fourharpooneers to sleep abreast  there   said the landlord  placing the candle on a crazy old sea chestthat did double duty as a wash stand and centre table   there  makeyourself comfortable now  and good night to ye   i turned round fromeyeing the bed  but he had disappeared folding back the counterpane  i stooped over the bed 
though none ofthe most elegant  it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well 
i thenglanced round the room  and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging to the place  but a rude shelf the four walls  and a papered fireboard representing a man striking awhale 
of things not properly belonging to the room  there was ahammock lashed up  and thrown upon the floor in one corner  also alarge seaman s bag  containing the harpooneer s wardrobe  no doubt inlieu of a land trunk 
likewise  there was a parcel of outlandish bonefish hooks on the shelf over the fire place  and a tall harpoonstanding at the head of the bed but what is this on the chest 
i took it up  and held it close to thelight  and felt it  and smelt it  and tried every way possible toarrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it 
i can compare itto nothing but a large door mat  ornamented at the edges with littletinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round anindian moccasin 
there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat  asyou see the same in south american ponchos 
but could it be possiblethat any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat  and parade thestreets of any christian town in that sort of guise 
i put it on  totry it  and it weighed me down like a hamper  being uncommonly shaggyand thick  and i thought a little damp  as though this mysteriousharpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day 
i went up in it to a bitof glass stuck against the wall  and i never saw such a sight in mylife 
i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kinkin the neck i sat down on the side of the bed  and commenced thinking about thishead peddling harpooneer  and his door mat 
after thinking some time onthe bed side  i got up and took off my monkey jacket  and then stood inthe middle of the room thinking 
i then took off my coat  and thought alittle more in my shirt sleeves 
but beginning to feel very cold now half undressed as i was  and remembering what the landlord said aboutthe harpooneer s not coming home at all that night  it being so verylate  i made no more ado  but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed  and commended myselfto the care of heaven whether that mattress was stuffed with corn cobs or broken crockery there is no telling  but i rolled about a good deal  and could notsleep for a long time 
at last i slid off into a light doze  and hadpretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod  when i hearda heavy footfall in the passage  and saw a glimmer of light come intothe room from under the door lord save me  thinks i  that must be the harpooneer  the infernalhead peddler 
but i lay perfectly still  and resolved not to say a wordtill spoken to 
holding a light in one hand  and that identical newzealand head in the other  the stranger entered the room  and withoutlooking towards the bed  placed his candle a good way off from me onthe floor in one corner  and then began working away at the knottedcords of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room 
i wasall eagerness to see his face  but he kept it averted for some timewhile employed in unlacing the bag s mouth 
this accomplished  however he turned round when  good heavens 
what a sight 
such a face 
it wasof a dark  purplish  yellow colour  here and there stuck over withlarge blackish looking squares 
yes  it s just as i thought  he s aterrible bedfellow  he s been in a fight  got dreadfully cut  and herehe is  just from the surgeon 
but at that moment he chanced to turn hisface so towards the light  that i plainly saw they could not besticking plasters at all  those black squares on his cheeks 
they werestains of some sort or other 
at first i knew not what to make of this but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me 
i remembered a storyof a white man a whaleman too who  falling among the cannibals  hadbeen tattooed by them 
i concluded that this harpooneer  in the courseof his distant voyages  must have met with a similar adventure 
andwhat is it  thought i  after all 
it s only his outside  a man can behonest in any sort of skin 
but then  what to make of his unearthlycomplexion  that part of it  i mean  lying round about  and completelyindependent of the squares of tattooing 
to be sure  it might benothing but a good coat of tropical tanning  but i never heard of a hotsun s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one 
however  i hadnever been in the south seas  and perhaps the sun there produced theseextraordinary effects upon the skin 
now  while all these ideas werepassing through me like lightning  this harpooneer never noticed me atall 
but  after some difficulty having opened his bag  he commencedfumbling in it  and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk  and aseal skin wallet with the hair on 
placing these on the old chest inthe middle of the room  he then took the new zealand head a ghastlything enough and crammed it down into the bag 
he now took off hishat a new beaver hat when i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise there was no hair on his head none to speak of at least nothing but asmall scalp knot twisted up on his forehead 
his bald purplish head nowlooked for all the world like a mildewed skull 
had not the strangerstood between me and the door  i would have bolted out of it quickerthan ever i bolted a dinner even as it was  i thought something of slipping out of the window  butit was the second floor back 
i am no coward  but what to make of thishead peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension ignorance is the parent of fear  and being completely nonplussed andconfounded about the stranger  i confess i was now as much afraid ofhim as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room atthe dead of night 
in fact  i was so afraid of him that i was not gameenough just then to address him  and demand a satisfactory answerconcerning what seemed inexplicable in him meanwhile  he continued the business of undressing  and at last showedhis chest and arms 
as i live  these covered parts of him werecheckered with the same squares as his face  his back  too  was allover the same dark squares  he seemed to have been in a thirty years war  and just escaped from it with a sticking plaster shirt 
stillmore  his very legs were marked  as if a parcel of dark green frogswere running up the trunks of young palms 
it was now quite plain thathe must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whalemanin the south seas  and so landed in this christian country 
i quaked tothink of it 
a peddler of heads too perhaps the heads of his ownbrothers 
he might take a fancy to mine heavens 
look at that tomahawk but there was no time for shuddering  for now the savage went aboutsomething that completely fascinated my attention  and convinced methat he must indeed be a heathen 
going to his heavy grego  or wrapall or dreadnaught  which he had previously hung on a chair  he fumbled inthe pockets  and produced at length a curious little deformed imagewith a hunch on its back  and exactly the colour of a three days  oldcongo baby 
remembering the embalmed head  at first i almost thoughtthat this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similarmanner 
but seeing that it was not at all limber  and that it glisteneda good deal like polished ebony  i concluded that it must be nothingbut a wooden idol  which indeed it proved to be 
for now the savagegoes up to the empty fire place  and removing the papered fire board sets up this little hunch backed image  like a tenpin  between theandirons 
the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty so that i thought this fire place made a very appropriate little shrineor chapel for his congo idol i now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image  feeling butill at ease meantime to see what was next to follow 
first he takesabout a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket  and placesthem carefully before the idol  then laying a bit of ship biscuit ontop and applying the flame from the lamp  he kindled the shavings intoa sacrificial blaze 
presently  after many hasty snatches into thefire  and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers  whereby he seemedto be scorching them badly   he at last succeeded in drawing out thebiscuit  then blowing off the heat and ashes a little  he made a politeoffer of it to the little negro 
but the little devil did not seem tofancy such dry sort of fare at all  he never moved his lips 
all thesestrange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises fromthe devotee  who seemed to be praying in a sing song or else singingsome pagan psalmody or other  during which his face twitched about inthe most unnatural manner 
at last extinguishing the fire  he took theidol up very unceremoniously  and bagged it again in his grego pocketas carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness  and seeinghim now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his businessoperations  and jumping into bed with me  i thought it was high time now or never  before the light was put out  to break the spell in whichi had so long been bound but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say  was a fatal one taking up his tomahawk from the table  he examined the head of it foran instant  and then holding it to the light  with his mouth at thehandle  he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke 
the next momentthe light was extinguished  and this wild cannibal  tomahawk betweenhis teeth  sprang into bed with me 
i sang out  i could not help itnow  and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me stammering out something  i knew not what  i rolled away from himagainst the wall  and then conjured him  whoever or whatever he mightbe  to keep quiet  and let me get up and light the lamp again 
but hisguttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended mymeaning  who e debel you   he at last said  you no speak e  dam me  i kill e  and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in thedark  landlord  for god s sake  peter coffin   shouted i 
save me   speak e 
tell ee me who ee be  or dam me  i kill e   again growled thecannibal  while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered thehot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on fire but thank heaven  at that moment the landlord came into the room lightin hand  and leaping from the bed i ran up to him  don t be afraid now   said he  grinning again   queequeg here wouldn tharm a hair of your head   stop your grinning   shouted i   and why didn t you tell me that thatinfernal harpooneer was a cannibal   i thought ye know d it  didn t i tell ye  he was a peddlin  headsaround town  but turn flukes again and go to sleep 
queequeg  lookhere you sabbee me  i sabbee you this man sleepe you you sabbee   me sabbee plenty  grunted queequeg  puffing away at his pipe andsitting up in bed  you gettee in   he added  motioning to me with his tomahawk  andthrowing the clothes to one side 
he really did this in not only acivil but a really kind and charitable way 
i stood looking at him amoment 
for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean  comelylooking cannibal 
what s all this fuss i have been making about thought i to myself the man s a human being just as i am  he has justas much reason to fear me  as i have to be afraid of him 
better sleepwith a sober cannibal than a drunken christian  landlord   said i   tell him to stash his tomahawk there  or pipe  orwhatever you call it  tell him to stop smoking  in short  and i willturn in with him 
but i don t fancy having a man smoking in bed withme 
it s dangerous 
besides  i ain t insured  this being told to queequeg  he at once complied  and again politelymotioned me to get into bed rolling over to one side as much as tosay  i won t touch a leg of ye   good night  landlord   said i   you may go  i turned in  and never slept better in my life chapter 4 
the counterpane upon waking next morning about daylight  i found queequeg s arm thrownover me in the most loving and affectionate manner 
you had almostthought i had been his wife 
the counterpane was of patchwork  full ofodd little parti coloured squares and triangles  and this arm of histattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure  notwo parts of which were of one precise shade owing i suppose to hiskeeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade  his shirtsleeves irregularly rolled up at various times this same arm of his  isay  looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchworkquilt 
indeed  partly lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke  icould hardly tell it from the quilt  they so blended their huestogether  and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that icould tell that queequeg was hugging me my sensations were strange 
let me try to explain them 
when i was achild  i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me whether it was a reality or a dream  i never could entirely settle 
thecircumstance was this 
i had been cutting up some caper or other ithink it was trying to crawl up the chimney  as i had seen a littlesweep do a few days previous  and my stepmother who  somehow or other was all the time whipping me  or sending me to bed supperless  mymother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off tobed  though it was only two o clock in the afternoon of the 21st june the longest day in the year in our hemisphere 
i felt dreadfully 
butthere was no help for it  so up stairs i went to my little room in thethird floor  undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapsebefore i could hope for a resurrection 
sixteen hours in bed 
the smallof my back ached to think of it 
and it was so light too  the sunshining in at the window  and a great rattling of coaches in thestreets  and the sound of gay voices all over the house 
i felt worseand worse at last i got up  dressed  and softly going down in mystockinged feet  sought out my stepmother  and suddenly threw myself ather feet  beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a goodslippering for my misbehaviour  anything indeed but condemning me tolie abed such an unendurable length of time 
but she was the best andmost conscientious of stepmothers  and back i had to go to my room 
forseveral hours i lay there broad awake  feeling a great deal worse thani have ever done since  even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze  andslowly waking from it half steeped in dreams i opened my eyes  and thebefore sun lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness 
instantly i felta shock running through all my frame  nothing was to be seen  andnothing was to be heard  but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine my arm hung over the counterpane  and the nameless  unimaginable silent form or phantom  to which the hand belonged  seemed closelyseated by my bed side 
for what seemed ages piled on ages  i lay there frozen with the most awful fears  not daring to drag away my hand  yetever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch  the horridspell would be broken 
i knew not how this consciousness at last glidedaway from me  but waking in the morning  i shudderingly remembered itall  and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself inconfounding attempts to explain the mystery 
nay  to this very hour  ioften puzzle myself with it now  take away the awful fear  and my sensations at feeling thesupernatural hand in mine were very similar  in their strangeness  tothose which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequeg s pagan armthrown round me 
but at length all the past night s events soberlyrecurred  one by one  in fixed reality  and then i lay only alive tothe comical predicament 
for though i tried to move his arm unlock hisbridegroom clasp yet  sleeping as he was  he still hugged me tightly as though naught but death should part us twain 
i now strove to rousehim  queequeg   but his only answer was a snore 
i then rolled over  myneck feeling as if it were in a horse collar  and suddenly felt aslight scratch 
throwing aside the counterpane  there lay the tomahawksleeping by the savage s side  as if it were a hatchet faced baby 
apretty pickle  truly  thought i  abed here in a strange house in thebroad day  with a cannibal and a tomahawk 
 queequeg  in the name ofgoodness  queequeg  wake   at length  by dint of much wriggling  andloud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of hishugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style  i succeeded inextracting a grunt  and presently  he drew back his arm  shook himselfall over like a newfoundland dog just from the water  and sat up inbed  stiff as a pike staff  looking at me  and rubbing his eyes as ifhe did not altogether remember how i came to be there  though a dimconsciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning overhim 
meanwhile  i lay quietly eyeing him  having no serious misgivingsnow  and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature 
when  atlast  his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow and he became  as it were  reconciled to the fact  he jumped out uponthe floor  and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that if it pleased me  he would dress first and then leave me to dressafterwards  leaving the whole apartment to myself 
thinks i  queequeg under the circumstances  this is a very civilized overture  but  thetruth is  these savages have an innate sense of delicacy  say what youwill  it is marvellous how essentially polite they are 
i pay thisparticular compliment to queequeg  because he treated me with so muchcivility and consideration  while i was guilty of great rudeness staring at him from the bed  and watching all his toilette motions  forthe time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding 
nevertheless a man like queequeg you don t see every day  he and his ways were wellworth unusual regarding he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat  a very tallone  by the by  and then still minus his trowsers he hunted up hisboots 
what under the heavens he did it for  i cannot tell  but hisnext movement was to crush himself boots in hand  and hat on under thebed  when  from sundry violent gaspings and strainings  i inferred hewas hard at work booting himself  though by no law of propriety that iever heard of  is any man required to be private when putting on hisboots 
but queequeg  do you see  was a creature in the transitionstage neither caterpillar nor butterfly 
he was just enough civilizedto show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners 
hiseducation was not yet completed 
he was an undergraduate 
if he had notbeen a small degree civilized  he very probably would not have troubledhimself with boots at all  but then  if he had not been still a savage he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on 
atlast  he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down overhis eyes  and began creaking and limping about the room  as if  notbeing much accustomed to boots  his pair of damp  wrinkled cowhideones probably not made to order either rather pinched and tormented himat the first go off of a bitter cold morning seeing  now  that there were no curtains to the window  and that thestreet being very narrow  the house opposite commanded a plain viewinto the room  and observing more and more the indecorous figure thatqueequeg made  staving about with little else but his hat and boots on i begged him as well as i could  to accelerate his toilet somewhat  andparticularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible 
hecomplied  and then proceeded to wash himself 
at that time in themorning any christian would have washed his face  but queequeg  to myamazement  contented himself with restricting his ablutions to hischest  arms  and hands 
he then donned his waistcoat  and taking up apiece of hard soap on the wash stand centre table  dipped it into waterand commenced lathering his face 
i was watching to see where he kepthis razor  when lo and behold  he takes the harpoon from the bedcorner  slips out the long wooden stock  unsheathes the head  whets ita little on his boot  and striding up to the bit of mirror against thewall  begins a vigorous scraping  or rather harpooning of his cheeks thinks i  queequeg  this is using rogers s best cutlery with avengeance 
afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i cameto know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made  and howexceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept the rest of his toilet was soon achieved  and he proudly marched out ofthe room  wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket  and sporting hisharpoon like a marshal s baton chapter 5 
breakfast i quickly followed suit  and descending into the bar room accosted thegrinning landlord very pleasantly 
i cherished no malice towards him though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of mybedfellow however  a good laugh is a mighty good thing  and rather too scarce agood thing  the more s the pity 
so  if any one man  in his own properperson  afford stuff for a good joke to anybody  let him not bebackward  but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent inthat way 
and the man that has anything bountifully laughable abouthim  be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for the bar room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in thenight previous  and whom i had not as yet had a good look at 
they werenearly all whalemen  chief mates  and second mates  and third mates and sea carpenters  and sea coopers  and sea blacksmiths  andharpooneers  and ship keepers  a brown and brawny company  with boskybeards  an unshorn  shaggy set  all wearing monkey jackets for morninggowns you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore 
thisyoung fellow s healthy cheek is like a sun toasted pear in hue  andwould seem to smell almost as musky  he cannot have been three dayslanded from his indian voyage 
that man next him looks a few shadeslighter  you might say a touch of satin wood is in him 
in thecomplexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn  but slightlybleached withal  he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore 
but whocould show a cheek like queequeg 
which  barred with various tints seemed like the andes  western slope  to show forth in one array contrasting climates  zone by zone  grub  ho   now cried the landlord  flinging open a door  and in wewent to breakfast they say that men who have seen the world  thereby become quite at easein manner  quite self possessed in company 
not always  though ledyard  the great new england traveller  and mungo park  the scotchone  of all men  they possessed the least assurance in the parlor 
butperhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs asledyard did  or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach  inthe negro heart of africa  which was the sum of poor mungo sperformances this kind of travel  i say  may not be the very best modeof attaining a high social polish 
still  for the most part  that sortof thing is to be had anywhere these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance thatafter we were all seated at the table  and i was preparing to hear somegood stories about whaling  to my no small surprise  nearly every manmaintained a profound silence 
and not only that  but they lookedembarrassed 
yes  here were a set of sea dogs  many of whom without theslightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas entirestrangers to them and duelled them dead without winking  and yet  herethey sat at a social breakfast table all of the same calling  all ofkindred tastes looking round as sheepishly at each other as though theyhad never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the greenmountains 
a curious sight  these bashful bears  these timid warriorwhalemen but as for queequeg why  queequeg sat there among them at the head ofthe table  too  it so chanced  as cool as an icicle 
to be sure icannot say much for his breeding 
his greatest admirer could not havecordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it there without ceremony  reaching over the table with it to the imminent jeopardy of many heads  and grappling the beefsteakstowards him 
but that was certainly very coolly done by him  andevery one knows that in most people s estimation  to do anything coollyis to do it genteelly we will not speak of all queequeg s peculiarities here  how he eschewedcoffee and hot rolls  and applied his undivided attention tobeefsteaks  done rare 
enough  that when breakfast was over he withdrewlike the rest into the public room  lighted his tomahawk pipe  and wassitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable haton  when i sallied out for a stroll chapter 6 
the street if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandishan individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of acivilized town  that astonishment soon departed upon taking my firstdaylight stroll through the streets of new bedford in thoroughfares nigh the docks  any considerable seaport willfrequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreignparts 
even in broadway and chestnut streets  mediterranean marinerswill sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies 
regent street is notunknown to lascars and malays  and at bombay  in the apollo green  liveyankees have often scared the natives 
but new bedford beats all waterstreet and wapping 
in these last mentioned haunts you see onlysailors  but in new bedford  actual cannibals stand chatting at streetcorners  savages outright  many of whom yet carry on their bones unholyflesh 
it makes a stranger stare but  besides the feegeeans  tongatobooarrs  erromanggoans  pannangians and brighggians  and  besides the wild specimens of the whaling craftwhich unheeded reel about the streets  you will see other sights stillmore curious  certainly more comical 
there weekly arrive in this townscores of green vermonters and new hampshire men  all athirst for gainand glory in the fishery 
they are mostly young  of stalwart frames fellows who have felled forests  and now seek to drop the axe andsnatch the whale lance 
many are as green as the green mountains whencethey came 
in some things you would think them but a few hours old look there 
that chap strutting round the corner 
he wears a beaver hatand swallow tailed coat  girdled with a sailor belt and sheath knife here comes another with a sou  wester and a bombazine cloak no town bred dandy will compare with a country bred one i mean adownright bumpkin dandy a fellow that  in the dog days  will mow histwo acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands 
now when acountry dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguishedreputation  and joins the great whale fishery  you should see thecomical things he does upon reaching the seaport 
in bespeaking hissea outfit  he orders bell buttons to his waistcoats  straps to hiscanvas trowsers 
ah  poor hay seed 
how bitterly will burst thosestraps in the first howling gale  when thou art driven  straps buttons  and all  down the throat of the tempest but think not that this famous town has only harpooneers  cannibals and bumpkins to show her visitors 
not at all 
still new bedford is aqueer place 
had it not been for us whalemen  that tract of land wouldthis day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast oflabrador 
as it is  parts of her back country are enough to frightenone  they look so bony 
the town itself is perhaps the dearest place tolive in  in all new england 
it is a land of oil  true enough  but notlike canaan  a land  also  of corn and wine 
the streets do not runwith milk  nor in the spring time do they pave them with fresh eggs yet  in spite of this  nowhere in all america will you find morepatrician like houses  parks and gardens more opulent  than in newbedford

yes  all these bravehouses and flowery gardens came from the atlantic  pacific  and indianoceans

i am sure that i did not returning from my first morning stroll  i again sallied out upon thisspecial errand 
the sky had changed from clear  sunny cold  to drivingsleet and mist 
wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth calledbearskin  i fought my way against the stubborn storm 
entering  i founda small scattered congregation of sailors  and sailors  wives andwidows 
a muffled silence reigned  only broken at times by the shrieksof the storm 
each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apartfrom the other  as if each silent grief were insular andincommunicable 
the chaplain had not yet arrived  and there thesesilent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marbletablets  with black borders  masoned into the wall on either side thepulpit 
three of them ran something like the following  but i do notpretend to quote  sacred to the memory of john talbot  who  at the age of eighteen  waslost overboard  near the isle of desolation  off patagonia  november1st  1836 
this tablet is erected to his memory by his sister sacred to the memory of robert long  willis ellery  nathan coleman walter canny  seth macy  and samuel gleig  forming one of the boats crews of the ship eliza who were towed out of sight by a whale  on theoff shore ground in the pacific  december 31st  1839 
this marbleis here placed by their surviving shipmates sacred to the memory of the late captain ezekiel hardy  who in the bowsof his boat was killed by a sperm whale on the coast of japan  august3d  1833 
this tablet is erected to his memory by his widow shaking off the sleet from my ice glazed hat and jacket  i seatedmyself near the door  and turning sideways was surprised to seequeequeg near me 
affected by the solemnity of the scene  there was awondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance 
this savagewas the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance  becausehe was the only one who could not read  and  therefore  was not readingthose frigid inscriptions on the wall 
whether any of the relatives ofthe seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation i knew not  but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if notthe trappings of some unceasing grief  that i feel sure that herebefore me were assembled those  in whose unhealing hearts the sight ofthose bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleedafresh oh 
ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass  who standingamong flowers can say here  here lies my beloved  ye know not thedesolation that broods in bosoms like these 
what bitter blanks inthose black bordered marbles which cover no ashes 
what despair inthose immovable inscriptions 
what deadly voids and unbiddeninfidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all faith  and refuseresurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without agrave 
as well might those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta ashere in what census of living creatures  the dead of mankind are included why it is that a universal proverb says of them  that they tell notales  though containing more secrets than the goodwin sands  how it isthat to his name who yesterday departed for the other world  we prefixso significant and infidel a word  and yet do not thus entitle him  ifhe but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth  why thelife insurance companies pay death forfeitures upon immortals  in whateternal  unstirring paralysis  and deadly  hopeless trance  yet liesantique adam who died sixty round centuries ago  how it is that westill refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain aredwelling in unspeakable bliss  why all the living so strive to hush allthe dead  wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrifya whole city 
all these things are not without their meanings but faith  like a jackal  feeds among the tombs  and even from thesedead doubts she gathers her most vital hope it needs scarcely to be told  with what feelings  on the eve of anantucket voyage  i regarded those marble tablets  and by the murkylight of that darkened  doleful day read the fate of the whalemen whohad gone before me 
yes  ishmael  the same fate may be thine 
butsomehow i grew merry again 
delightful inducements to embark  finechance for promotion  it seems aye  a stove boat will make me animmortal by brevet 
yes  there is death in this business of whaling aspeechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity 
but whatthen 
methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my truesubstance 
methinks that in looking at things spiritual  we are toomuch like oysters observing the sun through the water  and thinkingthat thick water the thinnest of air 
methinks my body is but the leesof my better being 
in fact take my body who will  take it i say  it isnot me 
and therefore three cheers for nantucket  and come a stove boatand stove body when they will  for stave my soul  jove himself cannot chapter 8 
the pulpit i had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerablerobustness entered  immediately as the storm pelted door flew back uponadmitting him  a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain 
yes  itwas the famous father mapple  so called by the whalemen  among whom hewas a very great favourite 
he had been a sailor and a harpooneer inhis youth  but for many years past had dedicated his life to theministry 
at the time i now write of  father mapple was in the hardywinter of a healthy old age  that sort of old age which seems merginginto a second flowering youth  for among all the fissures of hiswrinkles  there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developingbloom the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath february s snow 
noone having previously heard his history  could for the first timebehold father mapple without the utmost interest  because there werecertain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him  imputable to thatadventurous maritime life he had led 
when he entered i observed thathe carried no umbrella  and certainly had not come in his carriage  forhis tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet  and his great pilotcloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight ofthe water it had absorbed 
however  hat and coat and overshoes were oneby one removed  and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner when  arrayed in a decent suit  he quietly approached the pulpit like most old fashioned pulpits  it was a very lofty one  and since aregular stairs to such a height would  by its long angle with thefloor  seriously contract the already small area of the chapel  thearchitect  it seemed  had acted upon the hint of father mapple  andfinished the pulpit without a stairs  substituting a perpendicular sideladder  like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea 
the wifeof a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair ofred worsted man ropes for this ladder  which  being itself nicelyheaded  and stained with a mahogany colour  the whole contrivance considering what manner of chapel it was  seemed by no means in badtaste 
halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder  and with bothhands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man ropes  father mapplecast a look upwards  and then with a truly sailor like but stillreverential dexterity  hand over hand  mounted the steps as ifascending the main top of his vessel the perpendicular parts of this side ladder  as is usually the casewith swinging ones  were of cloth covered rope  only the rounds were ofwood  so that at every step there was a joint 
at my first glimpse ofthe pulpit  it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary 
for i was notprepared to see father mapple after gaining the height  slowly turnround  and stooping over the pulpit  deliberately drag up the ladderstep by step  till the whole was deposited within  leaving himimpregnable in his little quebec i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity andsanctity  that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by anymere tricks of the stage 
no  thought i  there must be some soberreason for this thing  furthermore  it must symbolize something unseen can it be  then  that by that act of physical isolation  he signifieshis spiritual withdrawal for the time  from all outward worldly tiesand connexions 
yes  for replenished with the meat and wine of theword  to the faithful man of god  this pulpit  i see  is aself containing stronghold a lofty ehrenbreitstein  with a perennialwell of water within the walls but the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place borrowed from the chaplain s former sea farings 
between the marblecenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit  the wall which formed its backwas adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beatingagainst a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowybreakers 
but high above the flying scud and dark rolling clouds  therefloated a little isle of sunlight  from which beamed forth an angel sface  and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon theship s tossed deck  something like that silver plate now inserted intothe victory s plank where nelson fell 
 ah  noble ship   the angelseemed to say   beat on  beat on  thou noble ship  and bear a hardyhelm  for lo 
the sun is breaking through  the clouds are rollingoff serenest azure is at hand  nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea taste thathad achieved the ladder and the picture 
its panelled front was in thelikeness of a ship s bluff bows  and the holy bible rested on aprojecting piece of scroll work  fashioned after a ship s fiddle headedbeak what could be more full of meaning  for the pulpit is ever this earth sforemost part  all the rest comes in its rear  the pulpit leads theworld 
from thence it is the storm of god s quick wrath is firstdescried  and the bow must bear the earliest brunt 
from thence it isthe god of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds yes  the world s a ship on its passage out  and not a voyage complete and the pulpit is its prow chapter 9 
the sermon father mapple rose  and in a mild voice of unassuming authority orderedthe scattered people to condense 
 starboard gangway  there 
side awayto larboard larboard gangway to starboard 
midships  there was a low rumbling of heavy sea boots among the benches  and astill slighter shuffling of women s shoes  and all was quiet again  andevery eye on the preacher he paused a little  then kneeling in the pulpit s bows  folded hislarge brown hands across his chest  uplifted his closed eyes  andoffered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and prayingat the bottom of the sea this ended  in prolonged solemn tones  like the continual tolling of abell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog in such tones hecommenced reading the following hymn  but changing his manner towardsthe concluding stanzas  burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy    the ribs and terrors in the whale  arched over me a dismal gloom   while all god s sun lit waves rolled by  and lift me deepening down  to doom 
 i saw the opening maw of hell  with endless pains and sorrows there   which none but they that feel can tell  oh  i was plunging to  despair 
 in black distress  i called my god  when i could scarce believe him  mine  he bowed his ear to my complaints  no more the whale did me  confine 
 with speed he flew to my relief  as on a radiant dolphin borne   awful  yet bright  as lightning shone the face of my deliverer god 
 my song for ever shall record that terrible  that joyful hour  i  give the glory to my god  his all the mercy and the power  nearly all joined in singing this hymn  which swelled high above thehowling of the storm 
a brief pause ensued  the preacher slowly turnedover the leaves of the bible  and at last  folding his hand down uponthe proper page  said   beloved shipmates  clinch the last verse of thefirst chapter of jonah  and god had prepared a great fish to swallow upjonah    shipmates  this book  containing only four chapters four yarns is oneof the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures 
yet whatdepths of the soul does jonah s deep sealine sound 
what a pregnantlesson to us is this prophet 
what a noble thing is that canticle inthe fish s belly 
how billow like and boisterously grand 
we feel thefloods surging over us  we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of thewaters  sea weed and all the slime of the sea is about us 
but whatis this lesson that the book of jonah teaches 
shipmates  it is atwo stranded lesson  a lesson to us all as sinful men  and a lesson tome as a pilot of the living god 
as sinful men  it is a lesson to usall  because it is a story of the sin  hard heartedness  suddenlyawakened fears  the swift punishment  repentance  prayers  and finallythe deliverance and joy of jonah 
as with all sinners among men  thesin of this son of amittai was in his wilful disobedience of thecommand of god never mind now what that command was  or howconveyed which he found a hard command 
but all the things that godwould have us do are hard for us to do remember that and hence  heoftener commands us than endeavors to persuade 
and if we obey god  wemust disobey ourselves  and it is in this disobeying ourselves  whereinthe hardness of obeying god consists  with this sin of disobedience in him  jonah still further flouts atgod  by seeking to flee from him 
he thinks that a ship made by menwill carry him into countries where god does not reign  but only thecaptains of this earth 
he skulks about the wharves of joppa  and seeksa ship that s bound for tarshish 
there lurks  perhaps  a hithertounheeded meaning here 
by all accounts tarshish could have been noother city than the modern cadiz 
that s the opinion of learned men and where is cadiz  shipmates 
cadiz is in spain  as far by water  fromjoppa  as jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days  whenthe atlantic was an almost unknown sea 
because joppa  the modernjaffa  shipmates  is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean the syrian  and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to thewestward from that  just outside the straits of gibraltar 
see ye notthen  shipmates  that jonah sought to flee world wide from god miserable man 
most contemptible and worthy of all scorn  withslouched hat and guilty eye  skulking from his god  prowling among theshipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas 
sodisordered  self condemning is his look  that had there been policemenin those days  jonah  on the mere suspicion of something wrong  hadbeen arrested ere he touched a deck 
how plainly he s a fugitive 
nobaggage  not a hat box  valise  or carpet bag  no friends accompany himto the wharf with their adieux 
at last  after much dodging search  hefinds the tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo  and ashe steps on board to see its captain in the cabin  all the sailors forthe moment desist from hoisting in the goods  to mark the stranger sevil eye 
jonah sees this  but in vain he tries to look all ease andconfidence  in vain essays his wretched smile 
strong intuitions of theman assure the mariners he can be no innocent 
in their gamesome butstill serious way  one whispers to the other  jack  he s robbed awidow   or   joe  do you mark him  he s a bigamist   or   harry lad  iguess he s the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah  or belike one of the missing murderers from sodom   another runs to read the billthat s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship ismoored  offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of aparricide  and containing a description of his person 
he reads  andlooks from jonah to the bill  while all his sympathetic shipmates nowcrowd round jonah  prepared to lay their hands upon him 
frighted jonahtrembles  and summoning all his boldness to his face  only looks somuch the more a coward 
he will not confess himself suspected  but thatitself is strong suspicion 
so he makes the best of it  and when thesailors find him not to be the man that is advertised  they let himpass  and he descends into the cabin   who s there   cries the captain at his busy desk  hurriedly makingout his papers for the customs  who s there   oh 
how that harmlessquestion mangles jonah 
for the instant he almost turns to flee again but he rallies 
 i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish  how soonsail ye  sir   thus far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah though the man now stands before him  but no sooner does he hear thathollow voice  than he darts a scrutinizing glance 
 we sail with thenext coming tide   at last he slowly answered  still intently eyeinghim 
 no sooner  sir    soon enough for any honest man that goes apassenger   ha 
jonah  that s another stab 
but he swiftly calls awaythe captain from that scent 
 i ll sail with ye   he says   the passagemoney how much is that  i ll pay now   for it is particularly written shipmates  as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history  that he paid the fare thereof  ere the craft did sail 
and taken withthe context  this is full of meaning  now jonah s captain  shipmates  was one whose discernment detectscrime in any  but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless 
inthis world  shipmates  sin that pays its way can travel freely  andwithout a passport  whereas virtue  if a pauper  is stopped at allfrontiers 
so jonah s captain prepares to test the length of jonah spurse  ere he judge him openly 
he charges him thrice the usual sum and it s assented to 
then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear withgold 
yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse  prudent suspicionsstill molest the captain 
he rings every coin to find a counterfeit not a forger  any way  he mutters  and jonah is put down for hispassage 
 point out my state room  sir   says jonah now   i mtravel weary  i need sleep    thou lookest like it   says the captain  there s thy room   jonah enters  and would lock the door  but the lockcontains no key 
hearing him foolishly fumbling there  the captainlaughs lowly to himself  and mutters something about the doors ofconvicts  cells being never allowed to be locked within 
all dressedand dusty as he is  jonah throws himself into his berth  and finds thelittle state room ceiling almost resting on his forehead 
the air isclose  and jonah gasps 
then  in that contracted hole  sunk  too beneath the ship s water line  jonah feels the heralding presentimentof that stifling hour  when the whale shall hold him in the smallest ofhis bowels  wards  screwed at its axis against the side  a swinging lamp slightlyoscillates in jonah s room  and the ship  heeling over towards thewharf with the weight of the last bales received  the lamp  flame andall  though in slight motion  still maintains a permanent obliquitywith reference to the room  though  in truth  infallibly straightitself  it but made obvious the false  lying levels among which ithung 
the lamp alarms and frightens jonah  as lying in his berth histormented eyes roll round the place  and this thus far successfulfugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance 
but thatcontradiction in the lamp more and more appals him 
the floor  theceiling  and the side  are all awry 
so my conscience hangs inme   he groans   straight upwards  so it burns  but the chambers of mysoul are all in crookedness   like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed  stillreeling  but with conscience yet pricking him  as the plungings of theroman race horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddyanguish  praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed  and atlast amid the whirl of woe he feels  a deep stupor steals over him  asover the man who bleeds to death  for conscience is the wound  andthere s naught to staunch it  so  after sore wrestlings in his berth jonah s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep  and now the time of tide has come  the ship casts off her cables  andfrom the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish  all careening glides to sea 
that ship  my friends  was the first of recordedsmugglers 
the contraband was jonah 
but the sea rebels  he will notbear the wicked burden 
a dreadful storm comes on  the ship is like tobreak 
but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her  whenboxes  bales  and jars are clattering overboard  when the wind isshrieking  and the men are yelling  and every plank thunders withtrampling feet right over jonah s head  in all this raging tumult jonah sleeps his hideous sleep 
he sees no black sky and raging sea feels not the reeling timbers  and little hears he or heeds he the farrush of the mighty whale  which even now with open mouth is cleavingthe seas after him 
aye  shipmates  jonah was gone down into the sidesof the ship a berth in the cabin as i have taken it  and was fastasleep 
but the frightened master comes to him  and shrieks in his deadear   what meanest thou  o  sleeper 
arise   startled from his lethargyby that direful cry  jonah staggers to his feet  and stumbling to thedeck  grasps a shroud  to look out upon the sea 
but at that moment heis sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks 
waveafter wave thus leaps into the ship  and finding no speedy vent runsroaring fore and aft  till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yetafloat 
and ever  as the white moon shows her affrighted face from thesteep gullies in the blackness overhead  aghast jonah sees the rearingbowsprit pointing high upward  but soon beat downward again towards thetormented deep  terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul 
in all hiscringing attitudes  the god fugitive is now too plainly known 
thesailors mark him  more and more certain grow their suspicions of him and at last  fully to test the truth  by referring the whole matter tohigh heaven  they fall to casting lots  to see for whose cause thisgreat tempest was upon them 
the lot is jonah s  that discovered  thenhow furiously they mob him with their questions 
 what is thineoccupation 
whence comest thou 
thy country 
what people 
but mark now my shipmates  the behavior of poor jonah 
the eager mariners but askhim who he is  and where from  whereas  they not only receive an answerto those questions  but likewise another answer to a question not putby them  but the unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hardhand of god that is upon him   i am a hebrew   he cries and then  i fear the lord the god of heavenwho hath made the sea and the dry land   fear him  o jonah 
aye  wellmightest thou fear the lord god then  straightway  he now goes on tomake a full confession  whereupon the mariners became more and moreappalled  but still are pitiful 
for when jonah  not yet supplicatinggod for mercy  since he but too well knew the darkness of hisdeserts  when wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast himforth into the sea  for he knew that for his sake this great tempestwas upon them  they mercifully turn from him  and seek by other meansto save the ship 
but all in vain  the indignant gale howls louder then  with one hand raised invokingly to god  with the other they notunreluctantly lay hold of jonah  and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east  and the seais still  as jonah carries down the gale with him  leaving smooth waterbehind 
he goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterlesscommotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething intothe yawning jaws awaiting him  and the whale shoots to all his ivoryteeth  like so many white bolts  upon his prison 
then jonah prayedunto the lord out of the fish s belly 
but observe his prayer  andlearn a weighty lesson 
for sinful as he is  jonah does not weep andwail for direct deliverance 
he feels that his dreadful punishment isjust 
he leaves all his deliverance to god  contenting himself withthis  that spite of all his pains and pangs  he will still look towardshis holy temple 
and here  shipmates  is true and faithful repentance not clamorous for pardon  but grateful for punishment 
and how pleasingto god was this conduct in jonah  is shown in the eventual deliveranceof him from the sea and the whale 
shipmates  i do not place jonahbefore you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as amodel for repentance 
sin not  but if you do  take heed to repent of itlike jonah  while he was speaking these words  the howling of the shrieking slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher  who when describing jonah s sea storm  seemed tossed by a storm himself his deep chest heaved as with a ground swell  his tossed arms seemedthe warring elements at work  and the thunders that rolled away fromoff his swarthy brow  and the light leaping from his eye  made all hissimple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them there now came a lull in his look  as he silently turned over theleaves of the book once more  and  at last  standing motionless  withclosed eyes  for the moment  seemed communing with god and himself but again he leaned over towards the people  and bowing his head lowly with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility  he spake thesewords  shipmates  god has laid but one hand upon you  both his hands pressupon me 
i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson thatjonah teaches to all sinners  and therefore to ye  and still more tome  for i am a greater sinner than ye 
and now how gladly would i comedown from this mast head and sit on the hatches there where you sit and listen as you listen  while some one of you reads me that otherand more awful lesson which jonah teaches to me  as a pilot of theliving god 
how being an anointed pilot prophet  or speaker of truethings  and bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in theears of a wicked nineveh  jonah  appalled at the hostility he shouldraise  fled from his mission  and sought to escape his duty and his godby taking ship at joppa 
but god is everywhere  tarshish he neverreached 
as we have seen  god came upon him in the whale  and swallowedhim down to living gulfs of doom  and with swift slantings tore himalong  into the midst of the seas   where the eddying depths sucked himten thousand fathoms down  and  the weeds were wrapped about his head  and all the watery world of woe bowled over him 
yet even then beyondthe reach of any plummet  out of the belly of hell  when the whalegrounded upon the ocean s utmost bones  even then  god heard theengulphed  repenting prophet when he cried 
then god spake unto thefish  and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea  the whalecame breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun  and all thedelights of air and earth  and  vomited out jonah upon the dry land  when the word of the lord came a second time  and jonah  bruised andbeaten his ears  like two sea shells  still multitudinously murmuringof the ocean jonah did the almighty s bidding 
and what was that shipmates 
to preach the truth to the face of falsehood 
that was it  this  shipmates  this is that other lesson  and woe to that pilot ofthe living god who slights it 
woe to him whom this world charms fromgospel duty 
woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when godhas brewed them into a gale 
woe to him who seeks to please rather thanto appal 
woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness 
woeto him who  in this world  courts not dishonor 
woe to him who wouldnot be true  even though to be false were salvation 
yea  woe to himwho  as the great pilot paul has it  while preaching to others ishimself a castaway  he dropped and fell away from himself for a moment  then lifting hisface to them again  showed a deep joy in his eyes  as he cried out witha heavenly enthusiasm   but oh 
on the starboard hand ofevery woe  there is a sure delight  and higher the top of that delight than the bottom of the woe is deep 
is not the main truck higher thanthe kelson is low 
delight is to him a far  far upward  and inwarddelight who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth  everstands forth his own inexorable self 
delight is to him whose strongarms yet support him  when the ship of this base treacherous world hasgone down beneath him 
delight is to him  who gives no quarter in thetruth  and kills  burns  and destroys all sin though he pluck it outfrom under the robes of senators and judges 
delight  top gallantdelight is to him  who acknowledges no law or lord  but the lord hisgod  and is only a patriot to heaven 
delight is to him  whom all thewaves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shakefrom this sure keel of the ages 
and eternal delight and deliciousnesswill be his  who coming to lay him down  can say with his finalbreath o father  chiefly known to me by thy rod mortal or immortal here i die 
i have striven to be thine  more than to be this world s or mine own 
yet this is nothing  i leave eternity to thee  for what isman that he should live out the lifetime of his god  he said no more  but slowly waving a benediction  covered his face withhis hands  and so remained kneeling  till all the people had departed and he was left alone in the place chapter 10 
a bosom friend returning to the spouter inn from the chapel  i found queequeg therequite alone  he having left the chapel before the benediction sometime 
he was sitting on a bench before the fire  with his feet on thestove hearth  and in one hand was holding close up to his face thatlittle negro idol of his  peering hard into its face  and with ajack knife gently whittling away at its nose  meanwhile humming tohimself in his heathenish way but being now interrupted  he put up the image  and pretty soon  goingto the table  took up a large book there  and placing it on his lapbegan counting the pages with deliberate regularity  at every fiftiethpage as i fancied stopping a moment  looking vacantly around him  andgiving utterance to a long drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment 
hewould then begin again at the next fifty  seeming to commence at numberone each time  as though he could not count more than fifty  and it wasonly by such a large number of fifties being found together  that hisastonishment at the multitude of pages was excited with much interest i sat watching him 
savage though he was  andhideously marred about the face at least to my taste his countenanceyet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable 
youcannot hide the soul 
through all his unearthly tattooings  i thought isaw the traces of a simple honest heart  and in his large  deep eyes fiery black and bold  there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare athousand devils 
and besides all this  there was a certain loftybearing about the pagan  which even his uncouthness could notaltogether maim 
he looked like a man who had never cringed and neverhad had a creditor 
whether it was  too  that his head being shaved his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief  and lookedmore expansive than it otherwise would  this i will not venture todecide  but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellentone 
it may seem ridiculous  but it reminded me of general washington shead  as seen in the popular busts of him 
it had the same longregularly graded retreating slope from above the brows  which werelikewise very projecting  like two long promontories thickly wooded ontop 
queequeg was george washington cannibalistically developed whilst i was thus closely scanning him  half pretending meanwhile to belooking out at the storm from the casement  he never heeded mypresence  never troubled himself with so much as a single glance  butappeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellousbook 
considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the nightprevious  and especially considering the affectionate arm i had foundthrown over me upon waking in the morning  i thought this indifferenceof his very strange 
but savages are strange beings  at times you donot know exactly how to take them 
at first they are overawing  theircalm self collectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom 
i hadnoticed also that queequeg never consorted at all  or but very little with the other seamen in the inn 
he made no advances whatever appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances all this struck me as mighty singular  yet  upon second thoughts  therewas something almost sublime in it 
here was a man some twenty thousandmiles from home  by the way of cape horn  that is which was the onlyway he could get there thrown among people as strange to him as thoughhe were in the planet jupiter  and yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving the utmost serenity  content with his own companionship always equal to himself 
surely this was a touch of fine philosophy though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that 
but perhaps  to be true philosophers  we mortals should not be conscious ofso living or so striving 
so soon as i hear that such or such a mangives himself out for a philosopher  i conclude that  like thedyspeptic old woman  he must have  broken his digester  as i sat there in that now lonely room  the fire burning low  in thatmild stage when  after its first intensity has warmed the air  it thenonly glows to be looked at  the evening shades and phantoms gatheringround the casements  and peering in upon us silent  solitary twain  thestorm booming without in solemn swells  i began to be sensible ofstrange feelings 
i felt a melting in me 
no more my splintered heartand maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world 
this soothingsavage had redeemed it 
there he sat  his very indifference speaking anature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and blanddeceits 
wild he was  a very sight of sights to see  yet i began tofeel myself mysteriously drawn towards him 
and those same things thatwould have repelled most others  they were the very magnets that thusdrew me 
i ll try a pagan friend  thought i  since christian kindnesshas proved but hollow courtesy 
i drew my bench near him  and made somefriendly signs and hints  doing my best to talk with him meanwhile 
atfirst he little noticed these advances  but presently  upon myreferring to his last night s hospitalities  he made out to ask mewhether we were again to be bedfellows 
i told him yes  whereat ithought he looked pleased  perhaps a little complimented we then turned over the book together  and i endeavored to explain tohim the purpose of the printing  and the meaning of the few picturesthat were in it 
thus i soon engaged his interest  and from that wewent to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights tobe seen in this famous town 
soon i proposed a social smoke  and producing his pouch and tomahawk  he quietly offered me a puff 
andthen we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his  and keeping itregularly passing between us if there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagan sbreast  this pleasant  genial smoke we had  soon thawed it out  andleft us cronies 
he seemed to take to me quite as naturally andunbiddenly as i to him  and when our smoke was over  he pressed hisforehead against mine  clasped me round the waist  and said thathenceforth we were married  meaning  in his country s phrase  that wewere bosom friends  he would gladly die for me  if need should be 
in acountryman  this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far toopremature  a thing to be much distrusted  but in this simple savagethose old rules would not apply after supper  and another social chat and smoke  we went to our roomtogether 
he made me a present of his embalmed head  took out hisenormous tobacco wallet  and groping under the tobacco  drew out somethirty dollars in silver  then spreading them on the table  andmechanically dividing them into two equal portions  pushed one of themtowards me  and said it was mine 
i was going to remonstrate  but hesilenced me by pouring them into my trowsers  pockets 
i let them stay he then went about his evening prayers  took out his idol  and removedthe paper fireboard 
by certain signs and symptoms  i thought he seemedanxious for me to join him  but well knowing what was to follow  ideliberated a moment whether  in case he invited me  i would comply orotherwise i was a good christian  born and bred in the bosom of the infalliblepresbyterian church 
how then could i unite with this wild idolator inworshipping his piece of wood 
but what is worship 
thought i 
do yousuppose now  ishmael  that the magnanimous god of heaven andearth pagans and all included can possibly be jealous of aninsignificant bit of black wood 
but what is worship  to dothe will of god that is worship 
and what is the will of god  to doto my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to me that isthe will of god 
now  queequeg is my fellow man 
and what do i wishthat this queequeg would do to me 
why  unite with me in my particularpresbyterian form of worship 
consequently  i must then unite with himin his  ergo  i must turn idolator 
so i kindled the shavings  helpedprop up the innocent little idol  offered him burnt biscuit withqueequeg  salamed before him twice or thrice  kissed his nose  and thatdone  we undressed and went to bed  at peace with our own consciencesand all the world 
but we did not go to sleep without some little chat how it is i know not  but there is no place like a bed for confidentialdisclosures between friends 
man and wife  they say  there open thevery bottom of their souls to each other  and some old couples oftenlie and chat over old times till nearly morning 
thus  then  in ourhearts  honeymoon  lay i and queequeg a cosy  loving pair chapter 11 
nightgown we had lain thus in bed  chatting and napping at short intervals  andqueequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legsover mine  and then drawing them back  so entirely sociable and freeand easy were we  when  at last  by reason of our confabulations  whatlittle nappishness remained in us altogether departed  and we felt likegetting up again  though day break was yet some way down the future yes  we became very wakeful  so much so that our recumbent positionbegan to grow wearisome  and by little and little we found ourselvessitting up  the clothes well tucked around us  leaning against thehead board with our four knees drawn up close together  and our twonoses bending over them  as if our kneepans were warming pans 
we feltvery nice and snug  the more so since it was so chilly out of doors indeed out of bed clothes too  seeing that there was no fire in theroom 
the more so  i say  because truly to enjoy bodily warmth  somesmall part of you must be cold  for there is no quality in this worldthat is not what it is merely by contrast 
nothing exists in itself 
ifyou flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable  and have beenso a long time  then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more 
butif  like queequeg and me in the bed  the tip of your nose or the crownof your head be slightly chilled  why then  indeed  in the generalconsciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm 
forthis reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich 
for the heightof this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanketbetween you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air 
then thereyou lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time  when all atonce i thought i would open my eyes  for when between sheets  whetherby day or by night  and whether asleep or awake  i have a way of alwayskeeping my eyes shut  in order the more to concentrate the snugness ofbeing in bed 
because no man can ever feel his own identity arightexcept his eyes be closed  as if darkness were indeed the properelement of our essences  though light be more congenial to our clayeypart 
upon opening my eyes then  and coming out of my own pleasant andself created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of theunilluminated twelve o clock at night  i experienced a disagreeablerevulsion 
nor did i at all object to the hint from queequeg thatperhaps it were best to strike a light  seeing that we were so wideawake  and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffsfrom his tomahawk 
be it said  that though i had felt such a strongrepugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before  yet see howelastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them for now i liked nothing better than to have queequeg smoking by me even in bed  because he seemed to be full of such serene household joythen 
i no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord s policy ofinsurance 
i was only alive to the condensed confidentialcomfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend with our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders  we now passed thetomahawk from one to the other  till slowly there grew over us a bluehanging tester of smoke  illuminated by the flame of the new lit lamp whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away tofar distant scenes  i know not  but he now spoke of his native island and  eager to hear his history  i begged him to go on and tell it 
hegladly complied 
though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few ofhis words  yet subsequent disclosures  when i had become more familiarwith his broken phraseology  now enable me to present the whole storysuch as it may prove in the mere skeleton i give chapter 12 
biographical queequeg was a native of rokovoko  an island far away to the west andsouth 
it is not down in any map  true places never are when a new hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in agrass clout  followed by the nibbling goats  as if he were a greensapling  even then  in queequeg s ambitious soul  lurked a strongdesire to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler ortwo 
his father was a high chief  a king  his uncle a high priest  andon the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives ofunconquerable warriors 
there was excellent blood in his veins royalstuff  though sadly vitiated  i fear  by the cannibal propensity henourished in his untutored youth a sag harbor ship visited his father s bay  and queequeg sought apassage to christian lands 
but the ship  having her full complement ofseamen  spurned his suit  and not all the king his father s influencecould prevail 
but queequeg vowed a vow 
alone in his canoe  he paddledoff to a distant strait  which he knew the ship must pass through whenshe quitted the island 
on one side was a coral reef  on the other alow tongue of land  covered with mangrove thickets that grew out intothe water 
hiding his canoe  still afloat  among these thickets  withits prow seaward  he sat down in the stern  paddle low in hand  andwhen the ship was gliding by  like a flash he darted out  gained herside  with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up the chains  and throwing himself at full length upon thedeck  grappled a ring bolt there  and swore not to let it go  thoughhacked in pieces in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard  suspended acutlass over his naked wrists  queequeg was the son of a king  andqueequeg budged not 
struck by his desperate dauntlessness  and hiswild desire to visit christendom  the captain at last relented  andtold him he might make himself at home 
but this fine young savage thissea prince of wales  never saw the captain s cabin 
they put him downamong the sailors  and made a whaleman of him 
but like czar petercontent to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities  queequeg disdainedno seeming ignominy  if thereby he might happily gain the power ofenlightening his untutored countrymen 
for at bottom so he told me hewas actuated by a profound desire to learn among the christians  thearts whereby to make his people still happier than they were  and morethan that  still better than they were 
but  alas 
the practices ofwhalemen soon convinced him that even christians could be bothmiserable and wicked  infinitely more so  than all his father sheathens 
arrived at last in old sag harbor  and seeing what thesailors did there  and then going on to nantucket  and seeing how theyspent their wages in that place also  poor queequeg gave it up forlost 
thought he  it s a wicked world in all meridians  i ll die apagan and thus an old idolator at heart  he yet lived among these christians wore their clothes  and tried to talk their gibberish 
hence the queerways about him  though now some time from home by hints  i asked him whether he did not propose going back  and havinga coronation  since he might now consider his father dead and gone  hebeing very old and feeble at the last accounts 
he answered no  notyet  and added that he was fearful christianity  or rather christians had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirtypagan kings before him 
but by and by  he said  he would return  assoon as he felt himself baptized again 
for the nonce  however  heproposed to sail about  and sow his wild oats in all four oceans 
theyhad made a harpooneer of him  and that barbed iron was in lieu of asceptre now i asked him what might be his immediate purpose  touching his futuremovements 
he answered  to go to sea again  in his old vocation 
uponthis  i told him that whaling was my own design  and informed him of myintention to sail out of nantucket  as being the most promising portfor an adventurous whaleman to embark from 
he at once resolved toaccompany me to that island  ship aboard the same vessel  get into thesame watch  the same boat  the same mess with me  in short to share myevery hap  with both my hands in his  boldly dip into the potluck ofboth worlds 
to all this i joyously assented  for besides the affectioni now felt for queequeg  he was an experienced harpooneer  and as such could not fail to be of great usefulness to one  who  like me  waswholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling  though well acquaintedwith the sea  as known to merchant seamen his story being ended with his pipe s last dying puff  queequegembraced me  pressed his forehead against mine  and blowing out thelight  we rolled over from each other  this way and that  and very soonwere sleeping chapter 13 
wheelbarrow next morning  monday  after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber for a block  i settled my own and comrade s bill  using  however  mycomrade s money 
the grinning landlord  as well as the boarders  seemedamazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up betweenme and queequeg especially as peter coffin s cock and bull storiesabout him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very personwhom i now companied with we borrowed a wheelbarrow  and embarking our things  including my ownpoor carpet bag  and queequeg s canvas sack and hammock  away we wentdown to  the moss   the little nantucket packet schooner moored at thewharf 
as we were going along the people stared  not at queequeg somuch for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in theirstreets  but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms 
but weheeded them not  going along wheeling the barrow by turns  and queequegnow and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs 
iasked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore  andwhether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons 
to this  insubstance  he replied  that though what i hinted was true enough  yethe had a particular affection for his own harpoon  because it was ofassured stuff  well tried in many a mortal combat  and deeply intimatewith the hearts of whales 
in short  like many inland reapers andmowers  who go into the farmers  meadows armed with their ownscythes though in no wise obliged to furnish them even so  queequeg for his own private reasons  preferred his own harpoon shifting the barrow from my hand to his  he told me a funny story aboutthe first wheelbarrow he had ever seen 
it was in sag harbor 
theowners of his ship  it seems  had lent him one  in which to carry hisheavy chest to his boarding house 
not to seem ignorant about thething though in truth he was entirely so  concerning the precise way inwhich to manage the barrow queequeg puts his chest upon it  lashes itfast  and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf 
 why  said i   queequeg  you might have known better than that  one wouldthink 
didn t the people laugh  upon this  he told me another story 
the people of his island ofrokovoko  it seems  at their wedding feasts express the fragrant waterof young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl  andthis punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braidedmat where the feast is held 
now a certain grand merchant ship oncetouched at rokovoko  and its commander from all accounts  a verystately punctilious gentleman  at least for a sea captain thiscommander was invited to the wedding feast of queequeg s sister  apretty young princess just turned of ten 
well  when all the weddingguests were assembled at the bride s bamboo cottage  this captainmarches in  and being assigned the post of honor  placed himself overagainst the punchbowl  and between the high priest and his majesty theking  queequeg s father 
grace being said  for those people have theirgrace as well as we though queequeg told me that unlike us  who at suchtimes look downwards to our platters  they  on the contrary  copyingthe ducks  glance upwards to the great giver of all feasts grace  isay  being said  the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorialceremony of the island  that is  dipping his consecrated andconsecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beveragecirculates 
seeing himself placed next the priest  and noting theceremony  and thinking himself being captain of a ship as having plainprecedence over a mere island king  especially in the king s ownhouse the captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in thepunchbowl  taking it i suppose for a huge finger glass 
 now   saidqueequeg   what you tink now  didn t our people laugh  at last  passage paid  and luggage safe  we stood on board theschooner 
hoisting sail  it glided down the acushnet river 
on oneside  new bedford rose in terraces of streets  their ice covered treesall glittering in the clear  cold air 
huge hills and mountains ofcasks on casks were piled upon her wharves  and side by side theworld wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last  whilefrom others came a sound of carpenters and coopers  with blended noisesof fires and forges to melt the pitch  all betokening that new cruiseswere on the start  that one most perilous and long voyage ended  onlybegins a second  and a second ended  only begins a third  and so on for ever and for aye 
such is the endlessness  yea  the intolerablenessof all earthly effort gaining the more open water  the bracing breeze waxed fresh  the littlemoss tossed the quick foam from her bows  as a young colt hissnortings 
how i snuffed that tartar air  how i spurned that turnpikeearth  that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavishheels and hoofs  and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the seawhich will permit no records at the same foam fountain  queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me his dusky nostrils swelled apart  he showed his filed and pointedteeth 
on  on we flew  and our offing gained  the moss did homage tothe blast  ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan sideways leaning  we sideways darted  every ropeyarn tingling like awire  the two tall masts buckling like indian canes in land tornadoes so full of this reeling scene were we  as we stood by the plungingbowsprit  that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances ofthe passengers  a lubber like assembly  who marvelled that two fellowbeings should be so companionable  as though a white man were anythingmore dignified than a whitewashed negro 
but there were some boobiesand bumpkins there  who  by their intense greenness  must have comefrom the heart and centre of all verdure 
queequeg caught one of theseyoung saplings mimicking him behind his back 
i thought the bumpkin shour of doom was come 
dropping his harpoon  the brawny savage caughthim in his arms  and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength sent him high up bodily into the air  then slightly tapping his sternin mid somerset  the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet while queequeg  turning his back upon him  lighted his tomahawk pipeand passed it to me for a puff  capting 
capting   yelled the bumpkin  running towards that officer  capting  capting  here s the devil   hallo  you sir   cried the captain  a gaunt rib of the sea  stalkingup to queequeg   what in thunder do you mean by that 
don t you knowyou might have killed that chap   what him say   said queequeg  as he mildly turned to me  he say   said i   that you came near kill e that man there   pointingto the still shivering greenhorn  kill e   cried queequeg  twisting his tattooed face into an unearthlyexpression of disdain   ah 
him bevy small e fish e  queequeg no kill eso small e fish e  queequeg kill e big whale   look you   roared the captain   i ll kill e you  you cannibal  ifyou try any more of your tricks aboard here  so mind your eye  but it so happened just then  that it was high time for the captain tomind his own eye 
the prodigious strain upon the main sail had partedthe weather sheet  and the tremendous boom was now flying from side toside  completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck 
the poorfellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly  was swept overboard  allhands were in a panic  and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it seemed madness 
it flew from right to left  and back again  almost inone ticking of a watch  and every instant seemed on the point ofsnapping into splinters 
nothing was done  and nothing seemed capableof being done  those on deck rushed towards the bows  and stood eyeingthe boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale 
in themidst of this consternation  queequeg dropped deftly to his knees  andcrawling under the path of the boom  whipped hold of a rope  securedone end to the bulwarks  and then flinging the other like a lasso caught it round the boom as it swept over his head  and at the nextjerk  the spar was that way trapped  and all was safe 
the schooner wasrun into the wind  and while the hands were clearing away the sternboat  queequeg  stripped to the waist  darted from the side with a longliving arc of a leap 
for three minutes or more he was seen swimminglike a dog  throwing his long arms straight out before him  and byturns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam 
ilooked at the grand and glorious fellow  but saw no one to be saved the greenhorn had gone down 
shooting himself perpendicularly from thewater  queequeg  now took an instant s glance around him  and seemingto see just how matters were  dived down and disappeared 
a few minutesmore  and he rose again  one arm still striking out  and with the otherdragging a lifeless form 
the boat soon picked them up 
the poorbumpkin was restored 
all hands voted queequeg a noble trump  thecaptain begged his pardon 
from that hour i clove to queequeg like abarnacle  yea  till poor queequeg took his last long dive was there ever such unconsciousness 
he did not seem to think that heat all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies 
heonly asked for water fresh water something to wipe the brine off  thatdone  he put on dry clothes  lighted his pipe  and leaning against thebulwarks  and mildly eyeing those around him  seemed to be saying tohimself  it s a mutual  joint stock world  in all meridians 
wecannibals must help these christians  chapter 14 
nantucket nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning  so  after afine run  we safely arrived in nantucket nantucket 
take out your map and look at it 
see what a real corner ofthe world it occupies  how it stands there  away off shore  more lonelythan the eddystone lighthouse 
look at it a mere hillock  and elbow ofsand  all beach  without a background 
there is more sand there thanyou would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper 
somegamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there  theydon t grow naturally  that they import canada thistles  that they haveto send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask  thatpieces of wood in nantucket are carried about like bits of the truecross in rome  that people there plant toadstools before their houses to get under the shade in summer time  that one blade of grass makes anoasis  three blades in a day s walk a prairie  that they wear quicksandshoes  something like laplander snow shoes  that they are so shut up belted about  every way inclosed  surrounded  and made an utter islandof by the ocean  that to their very chairs and tables small clams willsometimes be found adhering  as to the backs of sea turtles 
but theseextravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinois look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island wassettled by the red men 
thus goes the legend 
in olden times an eagleswooped down upon the new england coast  and carried off an infantindian in his talons 
with loud lament the parents saw their childborne out of sight over the wide waters 
they resolved to follow in thesame direction 
setting out in their canoes  after a perilous passagethey discovered the island  and there they found an empty ivorycasket  the poor little indian s skeleton what wonder  then  that these nantucketers  born on a beach  shouldtake to the sea for a livelihood 
they first caught crabs and quohogsin the sand  grown bolder  they waded out with nets for mackerel  moreexperienced  they pushed off in boats and captured cod  and at last launching a navy of great ships on the sea  explored this watery world put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it  peeped in atbehring s straits  and in all seasons and all oceans declaredeverlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived theflood  most monstrous and most mountainous 
that himmalehan  salt seamastodon  clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power  thathis very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless andmalicious assaults and thus have these naked nantucketers  these sea hermits  issuing fromtheir ant hill in the sea  overrun and conquered the watery world likeso many alexanders  parcelling out among them the atlantic  pacific and indian oceans  as the three pirate powers did poland 
let americaadd mexico to texas  and pile cuba upon canada  let the englishoverswarm all india  and hang out their blazing banner from the sun two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the nantucketer s 
for the seais his  he owns it  as emperors own empires  other seamen having but aright of way through it 
merchant ships are but extension bridges armed ones but floating forts  even pirates and privateers  thoughfollowing the sea as highwaymen the road  they but plunder other ships other fragments of the land like themselves  without seeking to drawtheir living from the bottomless deep itself 
the nantucketer  he aloneresides and riots on the sea  he alone  in bible language  goes down toit in ships  to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation there is his home  there lies his business  which a noah s floodwould not interrupt  though it overwhelmed all the millions in china he lives on the sea  as prairie cocks in the prairie  he hides amongthe waves  he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the alps 
for yearshe knows not the land  so that when he comes to it at last  it smellslike another world  more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman with the landless gull  that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked tosleep between billows  so at nightfall  the nantucketer  out of sightof land  furls his sails  and lays him to his rest  while under hisvery pillow rush herds of walruses and whales chapter 15 
chowder it was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly toanchor  and queequeg and i went ashore  so we could attend to nobusiness that day  at least none but a supper and a bed 
the landlordof the spouter inn had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey of thetry pots  whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kepthotels in all nantucket  and moreover he had assured us that cousinhosea  as he called him  was famous for his chowders 
in short  heplainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot luckat the try pots 
but the directions he had given us about keeping ayellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church tothe larboard  and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made acorner three points to the starboard  and that done  then ask the firstman we met where the place was  these crooked directions of his verymuch puzzled us at first  especially as  at the outset  queequeginsisted that the yellow warehouse our first point of departure must beleft on the larboard hand  whereas i had understood peter coffin to sayit was on the starboard 
however  by dint of beating about a little inthe dark  and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant toinquire the way  we at last came to something which there was nomistaking two enormous wooden pots painted black  and suspended by asses  ears swung from the cross trees of an old top mast  planted in front of anold doorway 
the horns of the cross trees were sawed off on the otherside  so that this old top mast looked not a little like a gallows perhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time  but icould not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving 
a sortof crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the two remaining horns  yes two of them  one for queequeg  and one for me 
it s ominous  thinksi 
a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port tombstones staring at me in the whalemen s chapel  and here a gallows and a pair of prodigious black pots too 
are these last throwing outoblique hints touching tophet i was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled womanwith yellow hair and a yellow gown  standing in the porch of the inn under a dull red lamp swinging there  that looked much like an injuredeye  and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollenshirt  get along with ye   said she to the man   or i ll be combing ye   come on  queequeg   said i   all right 
there s mrs  hussey  and so it turned out  mr  hosea hussey being from home  but leavingmrs 
hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs 
uponmaking known our desires for a supper and a bed  mrs  hussey postponing further scolding for the present  ushered us into a littleroom  and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recentlyconcluded repast  turned round to us and said  clam or cod   what s that about cods  ma am   said i  with much politeness  clam or cod   she repeated  a clam for supper 
a cold clam  is that what you mean  mrs  hussey  says i   but that s a rather cold and clammy reception in the wintertime  ain t it  mrs  hussey  but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purpleshirt  who was waiting for it in the entry  and seeming to hear nothingbut the word  clam   mrs  hussey hurried towards an open door leadingto the kitchen  and bawling out  clam for two   disappeared  queequeg   said i   do you think that we can make out a supper for usboth on one clam  however  a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie theapparently cheerless prospect before us 
but when that smoking chowdercame in  the mystery was delightfully explained 
oh  sweet friends hearken to me 
it was made of small juicy clams  scarcely bigger thanhazel nuts  mixed with pounded ship biscuit  and salted pork cut upinto little flakes  the whole enriched with butter  and plentifullyseasoned with pepper and salt 
our appetites being sharpened by thefrosty voyage  and in particular  queequeg seeing his favourite fishingfood before him  and the chowder being surpassingly excellent  wedespatched it with great expedition  when leaning back a moment andbethinking me of mrs  hussey s clam and cod announcement  i thought iwould try a little experiment 
stepping to the kitchen door  i utteredthe word  cod  with great emphasis  and resumed my seat 
in a fewmoments the savoury steam came forth again  but with a differentflavor  and in good time a fine cod chowder was placed before us we resumed business  and while plying our spoons in the bowl  thinks ito myself  i wonder now if this here has any effect on the head 
what sthat stultifying saying about chowder headed people 
 but look queequeg  ain t that a live eel in your bowl 
where s your harpoon  fishiest of all fishy places was the try pots  which well deserved itsname  for the pots there were always boiling chowders 
chowder forbreakfast  and chowder for dinner  and chowder for supper  till youbegan to look for fish bones coming through your clothes 
the areabefore the house was paved with clam shells 
mrs  hussey wore apolished necklace of codfish vertebra  and hosea hussey had his accountbooks bound in superior old shark skin 
there was a fishy flavor to themilk  too  which i could not at all account for  till one morninghappening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen sboats  i saw hosea s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants  andmarching along the sand with each foot in a cod s decapitated head looking very slip shod  i assure ye supper concluded  we received a lamp  and directions from mrs  husseyconcerning the nearest way to bed  but  as queequeg was about toprecede me up the stairs  the lady reached forth her arm  and demandedhis harpoon  she allowed no harpoon in her chambers 
 why not   said i  every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon but why not    becauseit s dangerous   says she 
 ever since young stiggs coming from thatunfort nt v y ge of his  when he was gone four years and a half  withonly three barrels of ile  was found dead in my first floor back with his harpoon in his side  ever since then i allow no boarders totake sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night 
so  mr  queequeg  for she had learned his name    i will just take this here iron  andkeep it for you till morning 
but the chowder  clam or cod to morrowfor breakfast  men   both   says i   and let s have a couple of smoked herring by way ofvariety  chapter 16 
the ship in bed we concocted our plans for the morrow 
but to my surprise and nosmall concern  queequeg now gave me to understand  that he had beendiligently consulting yojo the name of his black little god and yojohad told him two or three times over  and strongly insisted upon iteveryway  that instead of our going together among the whaling fleet inharbor  and in concert selecting our craft  instead of this  i say yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should restwholly with me  inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us  and  in orderto do so  had already pitched upon a vessel  which  if left to myself i  ishmael  should infallibly light upon  for all the world as thoughit had turned out by chance  and in that vessel i must immediately shipmyself  for the present irrespective of queequeg i have forgotten to mention that  in many things  queequeg placed greatconfidence in the excellence of yojo s judgment and surprising forecastof things  and cherished yojo with considerable esteem  as a rathergood sort of god  who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole  but inall cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs now  this plan of queequeg s  or rather yojo s  touching the selectionof our craft  i did not like that plan at all 
i had not a littlerelied upon queequeg s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted tocarry us and our fortunes securely 
but as all my remonstrancesproduced no effect upon queequeg  i was obliged to acquiesce  andaccordingly prepared to set about this business with a determinedrushing sort of energy and vigor  that should quickly settle thattrifling little affair 
next morning early  leaving queequeg shut upwith yojo in our little bedroom for it seemed that it was some sort oflent or ramadan  or day of fasting  humiliation  and prayer withqueequeg and yojo that day  how it was i never could find out  for though i applied myself to it several times  i never could master hisliturgies and xxxix articles leaving queequeg  then  fasting on histomahawk pipe  and yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire ofshavings  i sallied out among the shipping 
after much prolongedsauntering and many random inquiries  i learnt that there were threeships up for three years  voyages the devil dam  the tit bit  and thepequod 
devil dam  i do not know the origin of  tit bit is obvious pequod  you will no doubt remember  was the name of a celebratedtribe of massachusetts indians  now extinct as the ancient medes 
ipeered and pryed about the devil dam  from her  hopped over to thetit bit  and finally  going on board the pequod  looked around her fora moment  and then decided that this was the very ship for us you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day  for aught iknow  square toed luggers  mountainous japanese junks  butter boxgalliots  and what not  but take my word for it  you never saw such arare old craft as this same rare old pequod 
she was a ship of the oldschool  rather small if anything  with an old fashioned claw footedlook about her 
long seasoned and weather stained in the typhoons andcalms of all four oceans  her old hull s complexion was darkened like afrench grenadier s  who has alike fought in egypt and siberia 
hervenerable bows looked bearded 
her masts cut somewhere on the coast ofjapan  where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale her mastsstood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne 
herancient decks were worn and wrinkled  like the pilgrim worshippedflag stone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled 
but to all theseher old antiquities  were added new and marvellous features  pertainingto the wild business that for more than half a century she hadfollowed 
old captain peleg  many years her chief mate  before hecommanded another vessel of his own  and now a retired seaman  and oneof the principal owners of the pequod  this old peleg  during the termof his chief mateship  had built upon her original grotesqueness  andinlaid it  all over  with a quaintness both of material and device unmatched by anything except it be thorkill hake s carved buckler orbedstead 
she was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor  hisneck heavy with pendants of polished ivory 
she was a thing oftrophies 
a cannibal of a craft  tricking herself forth in the chasedbones of her enemies 
all round  her unpanelled  open bulwarks weregarnished like one continuous jaw  with the long sharp teeth of thesperm whale  inserted there for pins  to fasten her old hempen thewsand tendons to 
those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea ivory 
scorning a turnstilewheel at her reverend helm  she sported there a tiller  and that tillerwas in one mass  curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of herhereditary foe 
the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the tartar  when he holds back his fiery steed by clutchingits jaw 
a noble craft  but somehow a most melancholy 
all noble thingsare touched with that now when i looked about the quarter deck  for some one havingauthority  in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage  atfirst i saw nobody  but i could not well overlook a strange sort oftent  or rather wigwam  pitched a little behind the main mast 
itseemed only a temporary erection used in port 
it was of a conicalshape  some ten feet high  consisting of the long  huge slabs of limberblack bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of theright whale 
planted with their broad ends on the deck  a circle ofthese slabs laced together  mutually sloped towards each other  and atthe apex united in a tufted point  where the loose hairy fibres wavedto and fro like the top knot on some old pottowottamie sachem s head 
atriangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship  so that theinsider commanded a complete view forward and half concealed in this queer tenement  i at length found one who byhis aspect seemed to have authority  and who  it being noon  and theship s work suspended  was now enjoying respite from the burden ofcommand 
he was seated on an old fashioned oaken chair  wriggling allover with curious carving  and the bottom of which was formed of astout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam wasconstructed there was nothing so very particular  perhaps  about the appearance ofthe elderly man i saw  he was brown and brawny  like most old seamen and heavily rolled up in blue pilot cloth  cut in the quaker style only there was a fine and almost microscopic net work of the minutestwrinkles interlacing round his eyes  which must have arisen from hiscontinual sailings in many hard gales  and always looking towindward  for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursedtogether 
such eye wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl  is this the captain of the pequod   said i  advancing to the door ofthe tent  supposing it be the captain of the pequod  what dost thou want ofhim   he demanded  i was thinking of shipping   thou wast  wast thou 
i see thou art no nantucketer ever been in astove boat   no  sir  i never have   dost know nothing at all about whaling  i dare say eh  nothing  sir  but i have no doubt i shall soon learn 
i ve beenseveral voyages in the merchant service  and i think that   merchant service be damned 
talk not that lingo to me 
dost see thatleg  i ll take that leg away from thy stern  if ever thou talkest ofthe marchant service to me again 
marchant service indeed 
i supposenow ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchantships 
but flukes 
man  what makes thee want to go a whaling  eh  itlooks a little suspicious  don t it  eh  hast not been a pirate  hastthou  didst not rob thy last captain  didst thou  dost not think ofmurdering the officers when thou gettest to sea  i protested my innocence of these things 
i saw that under the mask ofthese half humorous innuendoes  this old seaman  as an insulatedquakerish nantucketer  was full of his insular prejudices  and ratherdistrustful of all aliens  unless they hailed from cape cod or thevineyard  but what takes thee a whaling 
i want to know that before i think ofshipping ye   well  sir  i want to see what whaling is 
i want to see the world   want to see what whaling is  eh 
have ye clapped eye on captain ahab   who is captain ahab  sir   aye  aye  i thought so 
captain ahab is the captain of this ship   i am mistaken then 
i thought i was speaking to the captain himself   thou art speaking to captain peleg that s who ye are speaking to young man 
it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fittedout for the voyage  and supplied with all her needs  including crew 
weare part owners and agents 
but as i was going to say  if thou wantestto know what whaling is  as thou tellest ye do  i can put ye in a wayof finding it out before ye bind yourself to it  past backing out 
clapeye on captain ahab  young man  and thou wilt find that he has only oneleg   what do you mean  sir 
was the other one lost by a whale   lost by a whale 
young man  come nearer to me  it was devoured  chewedup  crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped aboat  ah  ah  i was a little alarmed by his energy  perhaps also a little touched atthe hearty grief in his concluding exclamation  but said as calmly as icould   what you say is no doubt true enough  sir  but how could i knowthere was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale  though indeedi might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident   look ye now  young man  thy lungs are a sort of soft  d ye see  thoudost not talk shark a bit 
sure  ye ve been to sea before now  sureof that   sir   said i   i thought i told you that i had been four voyages inthe merchant   hard down out of that 
mind what i said about the marchantservice don t aggravate me i won t have it 
but let us understand eachother 
i have given thee a hint about what whaling is  do ye yet feelinclined for it   i do  sir   very good 
now  art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a livewhale s throat  and then jump after it 
answer  quick   i am  sir  if it should be positively indispensable to do so  not tobe got rid of  that is  which i don t take to be the fact   good again 
now then  thou not only wantest to go a whaling  to findout by experience what whaling is  but ye also want to go in order tosee the world 
was not that what ye said 
i thought so 
well then  juststep forward there  and take a peep over the weather bow  and then backto me and tell me what ye see there  for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request  notknowing exactly how to take it  whether humorously or in earnest 
butconcentrating all his crow s feet into one scowl  captain peleg startedme on the errand going forward and glancing over the weather bow  i perceived that theship swinging to her anchor with the flood tide  was now obliquelypointing towards the open ocean 
the prospect was unlimited  butexceedingly monotonous and forbidding  not the slightest variety that icould see  well  what s the report   said peleg when i came back   what did yesee   not much   i replied  nothing but water  considerable horizon though and there s a squall coming up  i think   well  what does thou think then of seeing the world 
do ye wish to goround cape horn to see any more of it  eh 
can t ye see the world whereyou stand  i was a little staggered  but go a whaling i must  and i would  and thepequod was as good a ship as any i thought the best and all this i nowrepeated to peleg 
seeing me so determined  he expressed hiswillingness to ship me  and thou mayest as well sign the papers right off   he added  comealong with ye   and so saying  he led the way below deck into thecabin seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon andsurprising figure 
it turned out to be captain bildad  who along withcaptain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel  the othershares  as is sometimes the case in these ports  being held by a crowdof old annuitants  widows  fatherless children  and chancery wards each owning about the value of a timber head  or a foot of plank  or anail or two in the ship 
people in nantucket invest their money inwhaling vessels  the same way that you do yours in approved statestocks bringing in good interest now  bildad  like peleg  and indeed many other nantucketers  was aquaker  the island having been originally settled by that sect  and tothis day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure thepeculiarities of the quaker  only variously and anomalously modified bythings altogether alien and heterogeneous 
for some of these samequakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale hunters 
theyare fighting quakers  they are quakers with a vengeance so that there are instances among them of men  who  named withscripture names a singularly common fashion on the island and inchildhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of thequaker idiom  still  from the audacious  daring  and boundlessadventure of their subsequent lives  strangely blend with theseunoutgrown peculiarities  a thousand bold dashes of character  notunworthy a scandinavian sea king  or a poetical pagan roman 
and whenthese things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force  with aglobular brain and a ponderous heart  who has also by the stillness andseclusion of many long night watches in the remotest waters  andbeneath constellations never seen here at the north  been led to thinkuntraditionally and independently  receiving all nature s sweet orsavage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confidingbreast  and thereby chiefly  but with some help from accidentaladvantages  to learn a bold and nervous lofty language that man makesone in a whole nation s census a mighty pageant creature  formed fornoble tragedies 
nor will it at all detract from him  dramaticallyregarded  if either by birth or other circumstances  he have what seemsa half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature 
forall men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness 
besure of this  o young ambition  all mortal greatness is but disease but  as yet we have not to do with such an one  but with quite another and still a man  who  if indeed peculiar  it only results again fromanother phase of the quaker  modified by individual circumstances like captain peleg  captain bildad was a well to do  retired whaleman but unlike captain peleg who cared not a rush for what are calledserious things  and indeed deemed those self same serious things theveriest of all trifles captain bildad had not only been originallyeducated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism  butall his subsequent ocean life  and the sight of many unclad  lovelyisland creatures  round the horn all that had not moved this nativeborn quaker one single jot  had not so much as altered one angle of hisvest 
still  for all this immutableness  was there some lack of commonconsistency about worthy captain bildad 
though refusing  fromconscientious scruples  to bear arms against land invaders  yet himselfhad illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific  and though a swornfoe to human bloodshed  yet had he in his straight bodied coat  spilledtuns upon tuns of leviathan gore 
how now in the contemplative eveningof his days  the pious bildad reconciled these things in thereminiscence  i do not know  but it did not seem to concern him much and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensibleconclusion that a man s religion is one thing  and this practical worldquite another 
this world pays dividends 
rising from a littlecabin boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab  to a harpooneer in abroad shad bellied waistcoat  from that becoming boat header chief mate  and captain  and finally a ship owner  bildad  as i hintedbefore  had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring fromactive life at the goodly age of sixty  and dedicating his remainingdays to the quiet receiving of his well earned income now  bildad  i am sorry to say  had the reputation of being anincorrigible old hunks  and in his sea going days  a bitter  hardtask master 
they told me in nantucket  though it certainly seems acurious story  that when he sailed the old categut whaleman  his crew upon arriving home  were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and worn out 
for a pious man  especially for a quaker he was certainly rather hard hearted  to say the least 
he never usedto swear  though  at his men  they said  but somehow he got aninordinate quantity of cruel  unmitigated hard work out of them 
whenbildad was a chief mate  to have his drab coloured eye intently lookingat you  made you feel completely nervous  till you could clutchsomething a hammer or a marling spike  and go to work like mad  atsomething or other  never mind what 
indolence and idleness perishedbefore him 
his own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitariancharacter 
on his long  gaunt body  he carried no spare flesh  nosuperfluous beard  his chin having a soft  economical nap to it  likethe worn nap of his broad brimmed hat such  then  was the person that i saw seated on the transom when ifollowed captain peleg down into the cabin 
the space between the deckswas small  and there  bolt upright  sat old bildad  who always sat so and never leaned  and this to save his coat tails 
his broad brim wasplaced beside him  his legs were stiffly crossed  his drab vesture wasbuttoned up to his chin  and spectacles on nose  he seemed absorbed inreading from a ponderous volume  bildad   cried captain peleg   at it again  bildad  eh 
ye have beenstudying those scriptures  now  for the last thirty years  to mycertain knowledge 
how far ye got  bildad  as if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate bildad  without noticing his present irreverence  quietly looked up and seeing me  glanced again inquiringly towards peleg  he says he s our man  bildad   said peleg   he wants to ship   dost thee   said bildad  in a hollow tone  and turning round to me  i dost   said i unconsciously  he was so intense a quaker  what do ye think of him  bildad   said peleg  he ll do   said bildad  eyeing me  and then went on spelling away athis book in a mumbling tone quite audible i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw  especially as peleg his friend and old shipmate  seemed such a blusterer 
but i saidnothing  only looking round me sharply 
peleg now threw open a chest and drawing forth the ship s articles  placed pen and ink before him and seated himself at a little table 
i began to think it was high timeto settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage forthe voyage 
i was already aware that in the whaling business they paidno wages  but all hands  including the captain  received certain sharesof the profits called lays  and that these lays were proportioned tothe degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of theship s company 
i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling  myown lay would not be very large  but considering that i was used to thesea  could steer a ship  splice a rope  and all that  i made no doubtthat from all i had heard i should be offered at least the 275thlay that is  the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage whatever that might eventually amount to 
and though the 275th lay waswhat they call a rather long lay  yet it was better than nothing  andif we had a lucky voyage  might pretty nearly pay for the clothing iwould wear out on it  not to speak of my three years  beef and board for which i would not have to pay one stiver it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princelyfortune and so it was  a very poor way indeed 
but i am one of thosethat never take on about princely fortunes  and am quite content if theworld is ready to board and lodge me  while i am putting up at thisgrim sign of the thunder cloud 
upon the whole  i thought that the275th lay would be about the fair thing  but would not have beensurprised had i been offered the 200th  considering i was of abroad shouldered make but one thing  nevertheless  that made me a little distrustful aboutreceiving a generous share of the profits was this  ashore  i had heardsomething of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad how that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod  thereforethe other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners  left nearly thewhole management of the ship s affairs to these two 
and i did not knowbut what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say aboutshipping hands  especially as i now found him on board the pequod quite at home there in the cabin  and reading his bible as if at hisown fireside 
now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with hisjack knife  old bildad  to my no small surprise  considering that hewas such an interested party in these proceedings  bildad never heededus  but went on mumbling to himself out of his book   lay not up foryourselves treasures upon earth  where moth   well  captain bildad   interrupted peleg   what d ye say  what layshall we give this young man   thou knowest best   was the sepulchral reply   the seven hundred andseventy seventh wouldn t be too much  would it   where moth and rust docorrupt  but lay   lay  indeed  thought i  and such a lay 
the seven hundred andseventy seventh 
well  old bildad  you are determined that i  for one shall not lay up many lays here below  where moth and rust docorrupt 
it was an exceedingly long lay that  indeed  and though fromthe magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman  yetthe slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred andseventy seven is a pretty large number  yet  when you come to make ateenth of it  you will then see  i say  that the seven hundred andseventy seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than sevenhundred and seventy seven gold doubloons  and so i thought at the time  why  blast your eyes  bildad   cried peleg   thou dost not want toswindle this young man 
he must have more than that   seven hundred and seventy seventh   again said bildad  without liftinghis eyes  and then went on mumbling  for where your treasure is  therewill your heart be also   i am going to put him down for the three hundredth   said peleg   doye hear that  bildad 
the three hundredth lay  i say  bildad laid down his book  and turning solemnly towards him said  captain peleg  thou hast a generous heart  but thou must consider theduty thou owest to the other owners of this ship widows and orphans many of them and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of thisyoung man  we may be taking the bread from those widows and thoseorphans 
the seven hundred and seventy seventh lay  captain peleg   thou bildad   roared peleg  starting up and clattering about thecabin 
 blast ye  captain bildad  if i had followed thy advice in thesematters  i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would beheavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round capehorn   captain peleg   said bildad steadily   thy conscience may be drawingten inches of water  or ten fathoms  i can t tell  but as thou artstill an impenitent man  captain peleg  i greatly fear lest thyconscience be but a leaky one  and will in the end sink thee founderingdown to the fiery pit  captain peleg   fiery pit 
fiery pit 
ye insult me  man  past all natural bearing  yeinsult me 
it s an all fired outrage to tell any human creature thathe s bound to hell 
flukes and flames 
bildad  say that again to me and start my soul bolts  but i ll i ll yes  i ll swallow a live goatwith all his hair and horns on 
out of the cabin  ye canting drab coloured son of a wooden gun a straight wake with ye  as he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad  but with amarvellous oblique  sliding celerity  bildad for that time eluded him alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal andresponsible owners of the ship  and feeling half a mind to give up allidea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarilycommanded  i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad  who i made no doubt  was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakenedwrath of peleg 
but to my astonishment  he sat down again on thetransom very quietly  and seemed to have not the slightest intention ofwithdrawing 
he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways 
asfor peleg  after letting off his rage as he had  there seemed no moreleft in him  and he  too  sat down like a lamb  though he twitched alittle as if still nervously agitated 
 whew   he whistled at last  thesquall s gone off to leeward  i think 
bildad  thou used to be good atsharpening a lance  mend that pen  will ye 
my jack knife here needsthe grindstone 
that s he  thank ye  bildad 
now then  my young man ishmael s thy name  didn t ye say 
well then  down ye go here  ishmael for the three hundredth lay   captain peleg   said i   i have a friend with me who wants to shiptoo shall i bring him down to morrow   to be sure   said peleg 
 fetch him along  and we ll look at him   what lay does he want   groaned bildad  glancing up from the book inwhich he had again been burying himself  oh 
never thee mind about that  bildad   said peleg 
 has he everwhaled it any   turning to me  killed more whales than i can count  captain peleg   well  bring him along then  and  after signing the papers  off i went  nothing doubting but that ihad done a good morning s work  and that the pequod was the identicalship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape but i had not proceeded far  when i began to bethink me that thecaptain with whom i was to sail yet remained unseen by me  though indeed  in many cases  a whale ship will be completely fitted out  andreceive all her crew on board  ere the captain makes himself visible byarriving to take command  for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief  that if thecaptain have a family  or any absorbing concernment of that sort  hedoes not trouble himself much about his ship in port  but leaves her tothe owners till all is ready for sea 
however  it is always as well tohave a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into hishands 
turning back i accosted captain peleg  inquiring where captainahab was to be found  and what dost thou want of captain ahab 
it s all right enough  thouart shipped   yes  but i should like to see him   but i don t think thou wilt be able to at present 
i don t knowexactly what s the matter with him  but he keeps close inside thehouse  a sort of sick  and yet he don t look so 
in fact  he ain tsick  but no  he isn t well either 
any how  young man  he won t alwayssee me  so i don t suppose he will thee 
he s a queer man  captainahab so some think but a good one 
oh  thou lt like him well enough  nofear  no fear 
he s a grand  ungodly  god like man  captain ahab doesn t speak much  but  when he does speak  then you may well listen mark ye  be forewarned  ahab s above the common  ahab s been incolleges  as well as  mong the cannibals  been used to deeper wondersthan the waves  fixed his fiery lance in mightier  stranger foes thanwhales 
his lance 
aye  the keenest and the surest that out of all ourisle 
he ain t captain bildad  no  and he ain t captain peleg he s ahab  boy  and ahab of old  thou knowest  was a crowned king   and a very vile one 
when that wicked king was slain  the dogs  didthey not lick his blood   come hither to me hither  hither   said peleg  with a significance inhis eye that almost startled me 
 look ye  lad  never say that on boardthe pequod 
never say it anywhere 
captain ahab did not name himself  twas a foolish  ignorant whim of his crazy  widowed mother  who diedwhen he was only a twelvemonth old 
and yet the old squaw tistig  atgayhead  said that the name would somehow prove prophetic 
and perhaps  other fools like her may tell thee the same 
i wish to warnthee 
it s a lie 
i know captain ahab well  i ve sailed with him asmate years ago  i know what he is a good man not a pious  good man like bildad  but a swearing good man something like me only there s agood deal more of him 
aye  aye  i know that he was never very jolly and i know that on the passage home  he was a little out of his mindfor a spell  but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stumpthat brought that about  as any one might see 
i know  too  that eversince he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale  he s been akind of moody desperate moody  and savage sometimes  but that will allpass off 
and once for all  let me tell thee and assure thee  youngman  it s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing badone 
so good bye to thee and wrong not captain ahab  because he happensto have a wicked name 
besides  my boy  he has a wife not three voyageswedded a sweet  resigned girl 
think of that  by that sweet girl thatold man has a child  hold ye then there can be any utter  hopeless harmin ahab 
no  no  my lad  stricken  blasted  if he be  ahab has hishumanities  as i walked away  i was full of thoughtfulness  what had beenincidentally revealed to me of captain ahab  filled me with a certainwild vagueness of painfulness concerning him 
and somehow  at the time i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him  but for i don t know what unless it was the cruel loss of his leg 
and yet i also felt a strangeawe of him  but that sort of awe  which i cannot at all describe  wasnot exactly awe  i do not know what it was 
but i felt it  and it didnot disincline me towards him  though i felt impatience at what seemedlike mystery in him  so imperfectly as he was known to me then however  my thoughts were at length carried in other directions  sothat for the present dark ahab slipped my mind chapter 17 
the ramadan as queequeg s ramadan  or fasting and humiliation  was to continue allday  i did not choose to disturb him till towards night fall  for icherish the greatest respect towards everybody s religious obligations never mind how comical  and could not find it in my heart to undervalueeven a congregation of ants worshipping a toad stool  or those othercreatures in certain parts of our earth  who with a degree offootmanism quite unprecedented in other planets  bow down before thetorso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of theinordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name i say  we good presbyterian christians should be charitable in thesethings  and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals pagans and what not  because of their half crazy conceits on thesesubjects 
there was queequeg  now  certainly entertaining the mostabsurd notions about yojo and his ramadan  but what of that 
queequegthought he knew what he was about  i suppose  he seemed to be content and there let him rest 
all our arguing with him would not avail  lethim be  i say  and heaven have mercy on us all presbyterians and pagansalike for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head  andsadly need mending towards evening  when i felt assured that all his performances andrituals must be over  i went up to his room and knocked at the door but no answer 
i tried to open it  but it was fastened inside  queequeg   said i softly through the key hole  all silent 
 i say queequeg 
why don t you speak 
it s i ishmael   but all remained stillas before 
i began to grow alarmed 
i had allowed him such abundanttime  i thought he might have had an apoplectic fit 
i looked throughthe key hole  but the door opening into an odd corner of the room  thekey hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one 
i could only seepart of the foot board of the bed and a line of the wall  but nothingmore 
i was surprised to behold resting against the wall the woodenshaft of queequeg s harpoon  which the landlady the evening previoushad taken from him  before our mounting to the chamber 
that s strange thought i  but at any rate  since the harpoon stands yonder  and heseldom or never goes abroad without it  therefore he must be insidehere  and no possible mistake  queequeg  queequeg   all still 
something must have happened apoplexy 
i tried to burst open the door  but it stubbornly resisted running down stairs  i quickly stated my suspicions to the first personi met the chamber maid 
la   she cried   i thought something mustbe the matter 
i went to make the bed after breakfast  and the door waslocked  and not a mouse to be heard  and it s been just so silent eversince 
but i thought  may be  you had both gone off and locked yourbaggage in for safe keeping 
la  ma am  mistress 
apoplexy   and with these cries  she ran towards the kitchen  ifollowing mrs 
hussey soon appeared  with a mustard pot in one hand and avinegar cruet in the other  having just broken away from the occupationof attending to the castors  and scolding her little black boymeantime  wood house   cried i   which way to it 
run for god s sake  and fetchsomething to pry open the door the axe  the axe 
he s had a stroke depend upon it   and so saying i was unmethodically rushing up stairsagain empty handed  when mrs  hussey interposed the mustard pot andvinegar cruet  and the entire castor of her countenance  what s the matter with you  young man   get the axe 
for god s sake  run for the doctor  some one  while i pryit open   look here   said the landlady  quickly putting down the vinegar cruet so as to have one hand free   look here  are you talking about pryingopen any of my doors   and with that she seized my arm 
 what s thematter with you 
what s the matter with you  shipmate  in as calm  but rapid a manner as possible  i gave her to understandthe whole case 
unconsciously clapping the vinegar cruet to one side ofher nose  she ruminated for an instant  then exclaimed  no 
i haven tseen it since i put it there   running to a little closet under thelanding of the stairs  she glanced in  and returning  told me thatqueequeg s harpoon was missing 
 he s killed himself   she cried 
 it sunfort nate stiggs done over again there goes another counterpane godpity his poor mother  it will be the ruin of my house 
has the poor lada sister 
where s that girl  there  betty  go to snarles the painter and tell him to paint me a sign  with  no suicides permitted here  andno smoking in the parlor   might as well kill both birds at once 
kill the lord be merciful to his ghost 
what s that noise there 
you  youngman  avast there  and running up after me  she caught me as i was again trying to forceopen the door  i don t allow it  i won t have my premises spoiled 
go for thelocksmith  there s one about a mile from here 
but avast   putting herhand in her side pocket   here s a key that ll fit  i guess  let ssee   and with that  she turned it in the lock  but  alas 
queequeg ssupplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within  have to burst it open   said i  and was running down the entry alittle  for a good start  when the landlady caught at me  again vowingi should not break down her premises  but i tore from her  and with asudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark with a prodigious noise the door flew open  and the knob slammingagainst the wall  sent the plaster to the ceiling  and there  goodheavens 
there sat queequeg  altogether cool and self collected  rightin the middle of the room  squatting on his hams  and holding yojo ontop of his head 
he looked neither one way nor the other way  but satlike a carved image with scarce a sign of active life  queequeg   said i  going up to him   queequeg  what s the matter withyou   he hain t been a sittin  so all day  has he   said the landlady but all we said  not a word could we drag out of him  i almost feltlike pushing him over  so as to change his position  for it was almostintolerable  it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained especially  as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards ofeight or ten hours  going too without his regular meals  mrs 
hussey   said i   he s alive at all events  so leave us  if youplease  and i will see to this strange affair myself  closing the door upon the landlady  i endeavored to prevail uponqueequeg to take a chair  but in vain 
there he sat  and all he coulddo for all my polite arts and blandishments he would not move a peg nor say a single word  nor even look at me  nor notice my presence inthe slightest way i wonder  thought i  if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan  dothey fast on their hams that way in his native island 
it must be so yes  it s part of his creed  i suppose  well  then  let him rest  he llget up sooner or later  no doubt 
it can t last for ever  thank god and his ramadan only comes once a year  and i don t believe it s verypunctual then i went down to supper 
after sitting a long time listening to the longstories of some sailors who had just come from a plum pudding voyage as they called it  that is  a short whaling voyage in a schooner orbrig  confined to the north of the line  in the atlantic ocean only  after listening to these plum puddingers till nearly eleven o clock  iwent up stairs to go to bed  feeling quite sure by this time queequegmust certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination 
but no  therehe was just where i had left him  he had not stirred an inch 
i beganto grow vexed with him  it seemed so downright senseless and insane tobe sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room holding a piece of wood on his head  for heaven s sake  queequeg  get up and shake yourself  get up andhave some supper 
you ll starve  you ll kill yourself  queequeg   butnot a word did he reply despairing of him  therefore  i determined to go to bed and to sleep and no doubt  before a great while  he would follow me 
but previous toturning in  i took my heavy bearskin jacket  and threw it over him  asit promised to be a very cold night  and he had nothing but hisordinary round jacket on 
for some time  do all i would  i could notget into the faintest doze 
i had blown out the candle  and the merethought of queequeg not four feet off sitting there in that uneasyposition  stark alone in the cold and dark  this made me reallywretched 
think of it  sleeping all night in the same room with a wideawake pagan on his hams in this dreary  unaccountable ramadan but somehow i dropped off at last  and knew nothing more till break ofday  when  looking over the bedside  there squatted queequeg  as if hehad been screwed down to the floor 
but as soon as the first glimpse ofsun entered the window  up he got  with stiff and grating joints  butwith a cheerful look  limped towards me where i lay  pressed hisforehead again against mine  and said his ramadan was over now  as i before hinted  i have no objection to any person s religion be it what it may  so long as that person does not kill or insult anyother person  because that other person don t believe it also 
but whena man s religion becomes really frantic  when it is a positive tormentto him  and  in fine  makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn tolodge in  then i think it high time to take that individual aside andargue the point with him and just so i now did with queequeg 
 queequeg   said i   get into bednow  and lie and listen to me   i then went on  beginning with the riseand progress of the primitive religions  and coming down to the variousreligions of the present time  during which time i labored to showqueequeg that all these lents  ramadans  and prolonged ham squattingsin cold  cheerless rooms were stark nonsense  bad for the health useless for the soul  opposed  in short  to the obvious laws of hygieneand common sense 
i told him  too  that he being in other things suchan extremely sensible and sagacious savage  it pained me  very badlypained me  to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculousramadan of his 
besides  argued i  fasting makes the body cave in hence the spirit caves in  and all thoughts born of a fast mustnecessarily be half starved 
this is the reason why most dyspepticreligionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters 
inone word  queequeg  said i  rather digressively  hell is an idea firstborn on an undigested apple dumpling  and since then perpetuatedthrough the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by ramadans i then asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled withdyspepsia  expressing the idea very plainly  so that he could take itin 
he said no  only upon one memorable occasion 
it was after a greatfeast given by his father the king  on the gaining of a great battlewherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o clock in theafternoon  and all cooked and eaten that very evening  no more  queequeg   said i  shuddering   that will do   for i knew theinferences without his further hinting them 
i had seen a sailor whohad visited that very island  and he told me that it was the custom when a great battle had been gained there  to barbecue all the slain inthe yard or garden of the victor  and then  one by one  they wereplaced in great wooden trenchers  and garnished round like a pilau with breadfruit and cocoanuts  and with some parsley in their mouths were sent round with the victor s compliments to all his friends  justas though these presents were so many christmas turkeys after all  i do not think that my remarks about religion made muchimpression upon queequeg 
because  in the first place  he somehowseemed dull of hearing on that important subject  unless consideredfrom his own point of view  and  in the second place  he did not morethan one third understand me  couch my ideas simply as i would  and finally  he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the truereligion than i did 
he looked at me with a sort of condescendingconcern and compassion  as though he thought it a great pity that sucha sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical paganpiety at last we rose and dressed  and queequeg  taking a prodigiously heartybreakfast of chowders of all sorts  so that the landlady should notmake much profit by reason of his ramadan  we sallied out to board thepequod  sauntering along  and picking our teeth with halibut bones chapter 18 
his mark as we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship  queequegcarrying his harpoon  captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed usfrom his wigwam  saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board thatcraft  unless they previously produced their papers  what do you mean by that  captain peleg   said i  now jumping on thebulwarks  and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf  i mean   he replied   he must show his papers   yes   said captain bildad in his hollow voice  sticking his head frombehind peleg s  out of the wigwam 
 he must show that he s converted son of darkness   he added  turning to queequeg   art thou at presentin communion with any christian church   why   said i   he s a member of the first congregational church   herebe it said  that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucket ships atlast come to be converted into the churches  first congregational church   cried bildad   what 
that worships indeacon deuteronomy coleman s meeting house   and so saying  taking outhis spectacles  he rubbed them with his great yellow bandanahandkerchief  and putting them on very carefully  came out of thewigwam  and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks  took a good long look atqueequeg  how long hath he been a member   he then said  turning to me   notvery long  i rather guess  young man   no   said peleg   and he hasn t been baptized right either  or itwould have washed some of that devil s blue off his face   do tell  now   cried bildad   is this philistine a regular member ofdeacon deuteronomy s meeting 
i never saw him going there  and i passit every lord s day   i don t know anything about deacon deuteronomy or his meeting   saidi   all i know is  that queequeg here is a born member of the firstcongregational church 
he is a deacon himself  queequeg is   young man   said bildad sternly   thou art skylarking with me explainthyself  thou young hittite 
what church dost thee mean 
answer me  finding myself thus hard pushed  i replied 
 i mean  sir  the sameancient catholic church to which you and i  and captain peleg there and queequeg here  and all of us  and every mother s son and soul of usbelong  the great and everlasting first congregation of this wholeworshipping world  we all belong to that  only some of us cherish somequeer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief  in that we alljoin hands   splice  thou mean st splice hands   cried peleg  drawing nearer  young man  you d better ship for a missionary  instead of a fore masthand  i never heard a better sermon 
deacon deuteronomy why fathermapple himself couldn t beat it  and he s reckoned something 
comeaboard  come aboard  never mind about the papers 
i say  tell quohogthere what s that you call him 
tell quohog to step along 
by the greatanchor  what a harpoon he s got there 
looks like good stuff that  andhe handles it about right 
i say  quohog  or whatever your name is  didyou ever stand in the head of a whale boat 
did you ever strike afish  without saying a word  queequeg  in his wild sort of way  jumped uponthe bulwarks  from thence into the bows of one of the whale boatshanging to the side  and then bracing his left knee  and poising hisharpoon  cried out in some such way as this   cap ain  you see him small drop tar on water dere 
you see him 
well spose him one whale eye  well  den   and taking sharp aim at it  hedarted the iron right over old bildad s broad brim  clean across theship s decks  and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight  now   said queequeg  quietly hauling in the line   spos ee him whale eeye  why  dad whale dead   quick  bildad   said peleg  his partner  who  aghast at the closevicinity of the flying harpoon  had retreated towards the cabingangway 
 quick  i say  you bildad  and get the ship s papers 
we musthave hedgehog there  i mean quohog  in one of our boats 
look ye quohog  we ll give ye the ninetieth lay  and that s more than ever wasgiven a harpooneer yet out of nantucket  so down we went into the cabin  and to my great joy queequeg was soonenrolled among the same ship s company to which i myself belonged when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready forsigning  he turned to me and said   i guess  quohog there don t knowhow to write  does he 
i say  quohog  blast ye 
dost thou sign thy nameor make thy mark  but at this question  queequeg  who had twice or thrice before takenpart in similar ceremonies  looked no ways abashed  but taking theoffered pen  copied upon the paper  in the proper place  an exactcounterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm  sothat through captain peleg s obstinate mistake touching hisappellative  it stood something like this  quohog 
his x mark meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of hisbroad skirted drab coat  took out a bundle of tracts  and selecting oneentitled  the latter day coming  or no time to lose   placed it inqueequeg s hands  and then grasping them and the book with both his looked earnestly into his eyes  and said   son of darkness  i must domy duty by thee  i am part owner of this ship  and feel concerned forthe souls of all its crew  if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways which i sadly fear  i beseech thee  remain not for aye a belialbondsman 
spurn the idol bell  and the hideous dragon  turn from thewrath to come  mind thine eye  i say  oh 
goodness gracious 
steerclear of the fiery pit  something of the salt sea yet lingered in old bildad s language heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases  avast there  avast there  bildad  avast now spoiling our harpooneer  cried peleg 
 pious harpooneers never make good voyagers it takes theshark out of  em  no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint prettysharkish 
there was young nat swaine  once the bravest boat header outof all nantucket and the vineyard  he joined the meeting  and nevercame to good 
he got so frightened about his plaguy soul  that heshrinked and sheered away from whales  for fear of after claps  in casehe got stove and went to davy jones   peleg 
peleg   said bildad  lifting his eyes and hands   thou thyself as i myself  hast seen many a perilous time  thou knowest  peleg  whatit is to have the fear of death  how  then  can st thou prate in thisungodly guise 
thou beliest thine own heart  peleg 
tell me  when thissame pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon onjapan  that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab  did stthou not think of death and the judgment then   hear him  hear him now   cried peleg  marching across the cabin  andthrusting his hands far down into his pockets   hear him  all of ye think of that 
when every moment we thought the ship would sink 
deathand the judgment then 
with all three masts making such aneverlasting thundering against the side  and every sea breaking overus  fore and aft 
think of death and the judgment then 
no time tothink about death then 
life was what captain ahab and i was thinkingof  and how to save all hands how to rig jury masts how to get into thenearest port  that was what i was thinking of  bildad said no more  but buttoning up his coat  stalked on deck  wherewe followed him 
there he stood  very quietly overlooking somesailmakers who were mending a top sail in the waist 
now and then hestooped to pick up a patch  or save an end of tarred twine  whichotherwise might have been wasted chapter 19 
the prophet  shipmates  have ye shipped in that ship  queequeg and i had just left the pequod  and were sauntering away fromthe water  for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts  when theabove words were put to us by a stranger  who  pausing before us levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question 
he was butshabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers  a rag of ablack handkerchief investing his neck 
a confluent small pox had in alldirections flowed over his face  and left it like the complicatedribbed bed of a torrent  when the rushing waters have been dried up  have ye shipped in her   he repeated  you mean the ship pequod  i suppose   said i  trying to gain a littlemore time for an uninterrupted look at him  aye  the pequod that ship there   he said  drawing back his whole arm and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him  with the fixedbayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object  yes   said i   we have just signed the articles   anything down there about your souls   about what   oh  perhaps you hav n t got any   he said quickly 
 no matter though i know many chaps that hav n t got any  good luck to  em  and they areall the better off for it 
a soul s a sort of a fifth wheel to awagon   what are you jabbering about  shipmate   said i  he s got enough  though  to make up for all deficiencies of thatsort in other chaps   abruptly said the stranger  placing a nervousemphasis upon the word he  queequeg   said i   let s go  this fellow has broken loose fromsomewhere  he s talking about something and somebody we don t know   stop   cried the stranger 
 ye said true ye hav n t seen old thunderyet  have ye   who s old thunder   said i  again riveted with the insane earnestnessof his manner  captain ahab   what 
the captain of our ship  the pequod   aye  among some of us old sailor chaps  he goes by that name 
yehav n t seen him yet  have ye   no  we hav n t 
he s sick they say  but is getting better  and will beall right again before long   all right again before long   laughed the stranger  with a solemnlyderisive sort of laugh 
 look ye  when captain ahab is all right  thenthis left arm of mine will be all right  not before   what do you know about him   what did they tell you about him 
say that   they didn t tell much of anything about him  only i ve heard that he sa good whale hunter  and a good captain to his crew   that s true  that s true yes  both true enough 
but you must jump whenhe gives an order 
step and growl  growl and go that s the word withcaptain ahab 
but nothing about that thing that happened to him offcape horn  long ago  when he lay like dead for three days and nights nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard afore the altarin santa  heard nothing about that  eh 
nothing about the silvercalabash he spat into 
and nothing about his losing his leg lastvoyage  according to the prophecy 
didn t ye hear a word about themmatters and something more  eh 
no  i don t think ye did  how could ye who knows it 
not all nantucket  i guess 
but hows ever  mayhap  ye veheard tell about the leg  and how he lost it  aye  ye have heard ofthat  i dare say 
oh yes  that every one knows a most i mean theyknow he s only one leg  and that a parmacetti took the other off   my friend   said i   what all this gibberish of yours is about  idon t know  and i don t much care  for it seems to me that you must bea little damaged in the head 
but if you are speaking of captain ahab of that ship there  the pequod  then let me tell you  that i know allabout the loss of his leg   all about it  eh sure you do  all   pretty sure  with finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod  the beggar likestranger stood a moment  as if in a troubled reverie  then starting alittle  turned and said   ye ve shipped  have ye 
names down on thepapers 
well  well  what s signed  is signed  and what s to be  willbe  and then again  perhaps it won t be  after all 
anyhow  it s allfixed and arranged a ready  and some sailors or other must go with him i suppose  as well these as any other men  god pity  em 
morning to ye shipmates  morning  the ineffable heavens bless ye  i m sorry i stoppedye   look here  friend   said i   if you have anything important to tellus  out with it  but if you are only trying to bamboozle us  you aremistaken in your game  that s all i have to say   and it s said very well  and i like to hear a chap talk up that way you are just the man for him the likes of ye 
morning to ye  shipmates morning 
when ye get there  tell  em i ve concluded not to make oneof  em   ah  my dear fellow  you can t fool us that way you can t fool us 
itis the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had agreat secret in him   morning to ye  shipmates  morning   morning it is   said i 
 come along  queequeg  let s leave this crazyman 
but stop  tell me your name  will you   elijah  elijah 
thought i  and we walked away  both commenting  after eachother s fashion  upon this ragged old sailor  and agreed that he wasnothing but a humbug  trying to be a bugbear 
but we had not goneperhaps above a hundred yards  when chancing to turn a corner  andlooking back as i did so  who should be seen but elijah following us though at a distance 
somehow  the sight of him struck me so  that isaid nothing to queequeg of his being behind  but passed on with mycomrade  anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same cornerthat we did 
he did  and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine 
thiscircumstance  coupled with his ambiguous  half hinting  half revealing shrouded sort of talk  now begat in me all kinds of vague wondermentsand half apprehensions  and all connected with the pequod  and captainahab  and the leg he had lost  and the cape horn fit  and the silvercalabash  and what captain peleg had said of him  when i left the shipthe day previous  and the prediction of the squaw tistig  and thevoyage we had bound ourselves to sail  and a hundred other shadowythings i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was reallydogging us or not  and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg and on that side of it retraced our steps 
but elijah passed on without seeming to notice us 
this relieved me  and once more  andfinally as it seemed to me  i pronounced him in my heart  a humbug chapter 20 
all astir a day or two passed  and there was great activity aboard the pequod not only were the old sails being mended  but new sails were coming onboard  and bolts of canvas  and coils of rigging  in short  everythingbetokened that the ship s preparations were hurrying to a close captain peleg seldom or never went ashore  but sat in his wigwamkeeping a sharp look out upon the hands  bildad did all the purchasingand providing at the stores  and the men employed in the hold and onthe rigging were working till long after night fall on the day following queequeg s signing the articles  word was given atall the inns where the ship s company were stopping  that their chestsmust be on board before night  for there was no telling how soon thevessel might be sailing 
so queequeg and i got down our traps resolving  however  to sleep ashore till the last 
but it seems theyalways give very long notice in these cases  and the ship did not sailfor several days 
but no wonder  there was a good deal to be done  andthere is no telling how many things to be thought of  before the pequodwas fully equipped every one knows what a multitude of things beds  sauce pans  knives andforks  shovels and tongs  napkins  nut crackers  and what not  areindispensable to the business of housekeeping 
just so with whaling which necessitates a three years  housekeeping upon the wide ocean  farfrom all grocers  costermongers  doctors  bakers  and bankers 
andthough this also holds true of merchant vessels  yet not by any meansto the same extent as with whalemen 
for besides the great length ofthe whaling voyage  the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecutionof the fishery  and the impossibility of replacing them at the remoteharbors usually frequented  it must be remembered  that of all ships whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds  andespecially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon whichthe success of the voyage most depends 
hence  the spare boats  sparespars  and spare lines and harpoons  and spare everythings  almost  buta spare captain and duplicate ship at the period of our arrival at the island  the heaviest storage of thepequod had been almost completed  comprising her beef  bread  water fuel  and iron hoops and staves 
but  as before hinted  for some timethere was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds andends of things  both large and small chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was captainbildad s sister  a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigablespirit  but withal very kindhearted  who seemed resolved that  if shecould help it  nothing should be found wanting in the pequod  afteronce fairly getting to sea 
at one time she would come on board with ajar of pickles for the steward s pantry  another time with a bunch ofquills for the chief mate s desk  where he kept his log  a third timewith a roll of flannel for the small of some one s rheumatic back never did any woman better deserve her name  which was charity auntcharity  as everybody called her 
and like a sister of charity did thischaritable aunt charity bustle about hither and thither  ready to turnher hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety  comfort and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brotherbildad was concerned  and in which she herself owned a score or two ofwell saved dollars but it was startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress coming onboard  as she did the last day  with a long oil ladle in one hand  anda still longer whaling lance in the other 
nor was bildad himself norcaptain peleg at all backward 
as for bildad  he carried about with hima long list of the articles needed  and at every fresh arrival  downwent his mark opposite that article upon the paper 
every once in awhile peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den  roaring at the mendown the hatchways  roaring up to the riggers at the mast head  andthen concluded by roaring back into his wigwam during these days of preparation  queequeg and i often visited thecraft  and as often i asked about captain ahab  and how he was  andwhen he was going to come on board his ship 
to these questions theywould answer  that he was getting better and better  and was expectedaboard every day  meantime  the two captains  peleg and bildad  couldattend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage 
if ihad been downright honest with myself  i would have seen very plainlyin my heart that i did but half fancy being committed this way to solong a voyage  without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be theabsolute dictator of it  so soon as the ship sailed out upon the opensea 
but when a man suspects any wrong  it sometimes happens that if hebe already involved in the matter  he insensibly strives to cover uphis suspicions even from himself 
and much this way it was with me 
isaid nothing  and tried to think nothing at last it was given out that some time next day the ship wouldcertainly sail 
so next morning  queequeg and i took a very earlystart chapter 21 
going aboard it was nearly six o clock  but only grey imperfect misty dawn  when wedrew nigh the wharf  there are some sailors running ahead there  if i see right   said i toqueequeg   it can t be shadows  she s off by sunrise  i guess  comeon   avast   cried a voice  whose owner at the same time coming closebehind us  laid a hand upon both our shoulders  and then insinuatinghimself between us  stood stooping forward a little  in the uncertaintwilight  strangely peering from queequeg to me 
it was elijah  going aboard   hands off  will you   said i  lookee here   said queequeg  shaking himself   go  way   ain t going aboard  then   yes  we are   said i   but what business is that of yours 
do youknow  mr  elijah  that i consider you a little impertinent   no  no  no  i wasn t aware of that   said elijah  slowly andwonderingly looking from me to queequeg  with the most unaccountableglances  elijah   said i   you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing 
weare going to the indian and pacific oceans  and would prefer not to bedetained   ye be  be ye 
coming back afore breakfast   he s cracked  queequeg   said i   come on   holloa   cried stationary elijah  hailing us when we had removed a fewpaces  never mind him   said i   queequeg  come on  but he stole up to us again  and suddenly clapping his hand on myshoulder  said  did ye see anything looking like men going towards thatship a while ago  struck by this plain matter of fact question  i answered  saying   yes i thought i did see four or five men  but it was too dim to be sure   very dim  very dim   said elijah 
 morning to ye  once more we quitted him  but once more he came softly after us  andtouching my shoulder again  said   see if you can find  em now  willye  find who   morning to ye 
morning to ye   he rejoined  again moving off 
iwas going to warn ye against but never mind  never mind it s all one all in the family too  sharp frost this morning  ain t it 
good bye toye 
shan t see ye again very soon  i guess  unless it s before thegrand jury   and with these cracked words he finally departed  leavingme  for the moment  in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence at last  stepping on board the pequod  we found everything in profoundquiet  not a soul moving 
the cabin entrance was locked within  thehatches were all on  and lumbered with coils of rigging 
going forwardto the forecastle  we found the slide of the scuttle open 
seeing alight  we went down  and found only an old rigger there  wrapped in atattered pea jacket 
he was thrown at whole length upon two chests  hisface downwards and inclosed in his folded arms 
the profoundest slumberslept upon him  those sailors we saw  queequeg  where can they have gone to   said i looking dubiously at the sleeper 
but it seemed that  when on thewharf  queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to  hence iwould have thought myself to have been optically deceived in thatmatter  were it not for elijah s otherwise inexplicable question 
but ibeat the thing down  and again marking the sleeper  jocularly hinted toqueequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body  telling him toestablish himself accordingly 
he put his hand upon the sleeper s rear as though feeling if it was soft enough  and then  without more ado sat quietly down there  gracious 
queequeg  don t sit there   said i  oh 
perry dood seat   said queequeg   my country way  won t hurt himface   face   said i   call that his face 
very benevolent countenance then but how hard he breathes  he s heaving himself  get off  queequeg  youare heavy  it s grinding the face of the poor 
get off  queequeg 
look he ll twitch you off soon 
i wonder he don t wake  queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper  andlighted his tomahawk pipe 
i sat at the feet 
we kept the pipe passingover the sleeper  from one to the other 
meanwhile  upon questioninghim in his broken fashion  queequeg gave me to understand that  in hisland  owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts  the king chiefs  and great people generally  were in the custom of fatteningsome of the lower orders for ottomans  and to furnish a housecomfortably in that respect  you had only to buy up eight or ten lazyfellows  and lay them round in the piers and alcoves 
besides  it wasvery convenient on an excursion  much better than those garden chairswhich are convertible into walking sticks  upon occasion  a chiefcalling his attendant  and desiring him to make a settee of himselfunder a spreading tree  perhaps in some damp marshy place while narrating these things  every time queequeg received the tomahawkfrom me  he flourished the hatchet side of it over the sleeper s head  what s that for  queequeg   perry easy  kill e  oh 
perry easy  he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk pipe which  it seemed  had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothedhis soul  when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger 
thestrong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole  it began totell upon him 
he breathed with a sort of muffledness  then seemedtroubled in the nose  then revolved over once or twice  then sat up andrubbed his eyes  holloa   he breathed at last   who be ye smokers   shipped men   answered i   when does she sail   aye  aye  ye are going in her  be ye 
she sails to day 
the captaincame aboard last night   what captain  ahab   who but him indeed  i was going to ask him some further questions concerning ahab  when weheard a noise on deck  holloa 
starbuck s astir   said the rigger 
 he s a lively chief mate that  good man  and a pious  but all alive now  i must turn to   and sosaying he went on deck  and we followed it was now clear sunrise 
soon the crew came on board in twos andthrees  the riggers bestirred themselves  the mates were activelyengaged  and several of the shore people were busy in bringing variouslast things on board 
meanwhile captain ahab remained invisiblyenshrined within his cabin chapter 22 
merry christmas at length  towards noon  upon the final dismissal of the ship sriggers  and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf  andafter the ever thoughtful charity had come off in a whale boat  withher last gift a night cap for stubb  the second mate  herbrother in law  and a spare bible for the steward after all this  thetwo captains  peleg and bildad  issued from the cabin  and turning tothe chief mate  peleg said  now  mr  starbuck  are you sure everything is right 
captain ahab isall ready just spoke to him nothing more to be got from shore  eh well  call all hands  then 
muster  em aft here blast  em   no need of profane words  however great the hurry  peleg   saidbildad   but away with thee  friend starbuck  and do our bidding  how now 
here upon the very point of starting for the voyage  captainpeleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on thequarter deck  just as if they were to be joint commanders at sea  aswell as to all appearances in port 
and  as for captain ahab  no signof him was yet to be seen  only  they said he was in the cabin 
butthen  the idea was  that his presence was by no means necessary ingetting the ship under weigh  and steering her well out to sea 
indeed as that was not at all his proper business  but the pilot s  and as hewas not yet completely recovered so they said therefore  captain ahabstayed below 
and all this seemed natural enough  especially as in themerchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for aconsiderable time after heaving up the anchor  but remain over thecabin table  having a farewell merry making with their shore friends before they quit the ship for good with the pilot but there was not much chance to think over the matter  for captainpeleg was now all alive 
he seemed to do most of the talking andcommanding  and not bildad  aft here  ye sons of bachelors   he cried  as the sailors lingered atthe main mast 
starbuck  drive  em aft   strike the tent there   was the next order 
as i hinted before  thiswhalebone marquee was never pitched except in port  and on board thepequod  for thirty years  the order to strike the tent was well knownto be the next thing to heaving up the anchor  man the capstan 
blood and thunder  jump   was the next command  andthe crew sprang for the handspikes now in getting under weigh  the station generally occupied by the pilotis the forward part of the ship 
and here bildad  who  with peleg  beit known  in addition to his other officers  was one of the licensedpilots of the port he being suspected to have got himself made a pilotin order to save the nantucket pilot fee to all the ships he wasconcerned in  for he never piloted any other craft bildad  i say  mightnow be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for theapproaching anchor  and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal staveof psalmody  to cheer the hands at the windlass  who roared forth somesort of a chorus about the girls in booble alley  with hearty goodwill 
nevertheless  not three days previous  bildad had told them thatno profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod  particularly ingetting under weigh  and charity  his sister  had placed a small choicecopy of watts in each seaman s berth meantime  overseeing the other part of the ship  captain peleg rippedand swore astern in the most frightful manner 
i almost thought hewould sink the ship before the anchor could be got up  involuntarily ipaused on my handspike  and told queequeg to do the same  thinking ofthe perils we both ran  in starting on the voyage with such a devil fora pilot 
i was comforting myself  however  with the thought that inpious bildad might be found some salvation  spite of his seven hundredand seventy seventh lay  when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear and turning round  was horrified at the apparition of captain peleg inthe act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity 
that was myfirst kick  is that the way they heave in the marchant service   he roared  spring  thou sheep head  spring  and break thy backbone 
why don t yespring  i say  all of ye spring 
spring  thou chap with the redwhiskers  spring there  scotch cap  spring  thou green pants 
spring  isay  all of ye  and spring your eyes out   and so saying  he movedalong the windlass  here and there using his leg very freely  whileimperturbable bildad kept leading off with his psalmody 
thinks i captain peleg must have been drinking something to day at last the anchor was up  the sails were set  and off we glided 
itwas a short  cold christmas  and as the short northern day merged intonight  we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean  whosefreezing spray cased us in ice  as in polished armor 
the long rows ofteeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight  and like the whiteivory tusks of some huge elephant  vast curving icicles depended fromthe bows lank bildad  as pilot  headed the first watch  and ever and anon  asthe old craft deep dived into the green seas  and sent the shiveringfrost all over her  and the winds howled  and the cordage rang  hissteady notes were heard   sweet fields beyond the swelling flood  stand dressed in livinggreen 
so to the jews old canaan stood  while jordan rolled between  never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then 
theywere full of hope and fruition 
spite of this frigid winter night inthe boisterous atlantic  spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket  therewas yet  it then seemed to me  many a pleasant haven in store  andmeads and glades so eternally vernal  that the grass shot up by thespring  untrodden  unwilted  remains at midsummer at last we gained such an offing  that the two pilots were needed nolonger 
the stout sail boat that had accompanied us began rangingalongside it was curious and not unpleasing  how peleg and bildad were affectedat this juncture  especially captain bildad 
for loath to depart  yet very loath to leave  for good  a ship bound on so long and perilous avoyage beyond both stormy capes  a ship in which some thousands of hishard earned dollars were invested  a ship  in which an old shipmatesailed as captain  a man almost as old as he  once more starting toencounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw  loath to say good bye toa thing so every way brimful of every interest to him  poor old bildadlingered long  paced the deck with anxious strides  ran down into thecabin to speak another farewell word there  again came on deck  andlooked to windward  looked towards the wide and endless waters  onlybounded by the far off unseen eastern continents  looked towards theland  looked aloft  looked right and left  looked everywhere andnowhere  and at last  mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand  and holding up a lantern for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face  as much as to say  nevertheless  friend peleg  i can stand it  yes  i can  as for peleg himself  he took it more like a philosopher  but for allhis philosophy  there was a tear twinkling in his eye  when the lanterncame too near 
and he  too  did not a little run from cabin to deck nowa word below  and now a word with starbuck  the chief mate but  at last  he turned to his comrade  with a final sort of look abouthim   captain bildad come  old shipmate  we must go

the advocate as queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded amonglandsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit  therefore  iam all anxiety to convince ye  ye landsmen  of the injustice herebydone to us hunters of whales in the first place  it may be deemed almost superfluous to establishthe fact  that among people at large  the business of whaling is notaccounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions 
if astranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits  werehe presented to the company as a harpooneer  say  and if in emulationof the naval officers he should append the initials s w f 
 sperm whalefishery  to his visiting card  such a procedure would be deemedpre eminently presuming and ridiculous doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring uswhalemen  is this  they think that  at best  our vocation amounts to abutchering sort of business  and that when actively engaged therein  weare surrounded by all manner of defilements 
butchers we are  that istrue 
but butchers  also  and butchers of the bloodiest badge have beenall martial commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor 
andas for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business  yeshall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generallyunknown  and which  upon the whole  will triumphantly plant the spermwhale ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth 
buteven granting the charge in question to be true  what disorderedslippery decks of a whale ship are comparable to the unspeakablecarrion of those battle fields from which so many soldiers return todrink in all ladies  plaudits 
and if the idea of peril so muchenhances the popular conceit of the soldier s profession  let me assureye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery  wouldquickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale s vast tail fanning into eddies the air over his head 
for what are thecomprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors andwonders of god but  though the world scouts at us whale hunters  yet does itunwittingly pay us the profoundest homage  yea  an all aboundingadoration 
for almost all the tapers  lamps  and candles that burnround the globe  burn  as before so many shrines  to our glory but look at this matter in other lights  weigh it in all sorts ofscales  see what we whalemen are  and have been why did the dutch in de witt s time have admirals of their whalingfleets 
why did louis xvi 
of france  at his own personal expense  fitout whaling ships from dunkirk  and politely invite to that town somescore or two of families from our own island of nantucket 
why didbritain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bountiesupwards of  1 000 000 
and lastly  how comes it that we whalemen ofamerica now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels  manned by eighteenthousand men  yearly consuming 4 000 000 of dollars  the ships worth at the time of sailing   20 000 000 
and every year importing into ourharbors a well reaped harvest of  7 000 000 
how comes all this  ifthere be not something puissant in whaling but this is not the half  look again i freely assert  that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot  for his life point out one single peaceful influence  which within the last sixtyyears has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world  takenin one aggregate  than the high and mighty business of whaling 
one wayand another  it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves  and socontinuously momentous in their sequential issues  that whaling maywell be regarded as that egyptian mother  who bore offspring themselvespregnant from her womb 
it would be a hopeless  endless task tocatalogue all these things 
let a handful suffice 
for many years pastthe whale ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest andleast known parts of the earth 
she has explored seas and archipelagoeswhich had no chart  where no cook or vancouver had ever sailed 
ifamerican and european men of war now peacefully ride in once savageharbors  let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of thewhale ship  which originally showed them the way  and first interpretedbetween them and the savages 
they may celebrate as they will theheroes of exploring expeditions  your cooks  your krusensterns  but isay that scores of anonymous captains have sailed out of nantucket that were as great  and greater than your cook and your krusenstern for in their succourless empty handedness  they  in the heathenishsharked waters  and by the beaches of unrecorded  javelin islands battled with virgin wonders and terrors that cook with all his marinesand muskets would not willingly have dared 
all that is made such aflourish of in the old south sea voyages  those things were but thelife time commonplaces of our heroic nantucketers 
often  adventureswhich vancouver dedicates three chapters to  these men accountedunworthy of being set down in the ship s common log 
ah  the world 
oh the world until the whale fishery rounded cape horn  no commerce but colonial scarcely any intercourse but colonial  was carried on between europeand the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacificcoast 
it was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policyof the spanish crown  touching those colonies  and  if space permitted it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuatedthe liberation of peru  chili  and bolivia from the yoke of old spain and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts that great america on the other side of the sphere  australia  wasgiven to the enlightened world by the whaleman 
after its firstblunder born discovery by a dutchman  all other ships long shunnedthose shores as pestiferously barbarous  but the whale ship touchedthere 
the whale ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony moreover  in the infancy of the first australian settlement  theemigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolentbiscuit of the whale ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters the uncounted isles of all polynesia confess the same truth  and docommercial homage to the whale ship  that cleared the way for themissionary and the merchant  and in many cases carried the primitivemissionaries to their first destinations 
if that double bolted land japan  is ever to become hospitable  it is the whale ship alone to whomthe credit will be due  for already she is on the threshold but if  in the face of all this  you still declare that whaling has noæsthetically noble associations connected with it  then am i ready toshiver fifty lances with you there  and unhorse you with a split helmetevery time the whale has no famous author  and whaling no famous chronicler  youwill say the whale no famous author  and whaling no famous chronicler  whowrote the first account of our leviathan 
who but mighty job 
and whocomposed the first narrative of a whaling voyage 
who  but no less aprince than alfred the great  who  with his own royal pen  took downthe words from other  the norwegian whale hunter of those times 
andwho pronounced our glowing eulogy in parliament 
who  but edmund burke true enough  but then whalemen themselves are poor devils  they have nogood blood in their veins no good blood in their veins  they have something better than royalblood there

postscript in behalf of the dignity of whaling  i would fain advance naught butsubstantiated facts 
but after embattling his facts  an advocate whoshould wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise  which might telleloquently upon his cause such an advocate  would he not beblameworthy it is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens  evenmodern ones  a certain curious process of seasoning them for theirfunctions is gone through 
there is a saltcellar of state  so called and there may be a castor of state 
how they use the salt precisely who knows 
certain i am  however  that a king s head issolemnly oiled at his coronation  even as a head of salad 
can it be though  that they anoint it with a view of making its interior runwell  as they anoint machinery 
much might be ruminated here concerning the essential dignity of this regal process  because incommon life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anointshis hair  and palpably smells of that anointing 
in truth  a mature manwho uses hair oil  unless medicinally  that man has probably got aquoggy spot in him somewhere 
as a general rule  he can t amount tomuch in his totality but the only thing to be considered here  is this what kind of oil isused at coronations 
certainly it cannot be olive oil  nor macassaroil  nor castor oil  nor bear s oil  nor train oil  nor cod liver oil what then can it possibly be  but sperm oil in its unmanufactured unpolluted state  the sweetest of all oils think of that  ye loyal britons

knights and squires the chief mate of the pequod was starbuck  a native of nantucket  and aquaker by descent 
he was a long  earnest man  and though born on anicy coast  seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes  his flesh beinghard as twice baked biscuit 
transported to the indies  his live bloodwould not spoil like bottled ale 
he must have been born in some timeof general drought and famine  or upon one of those fast days for whichhis state is famous 
only some thirty arid summers had he seen  thosesummers had dried up all his physical superfluousness 
but this  histhinness  so to speak  seemed no more the token of wasting anxietiesand cares  than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight 
it wasmerely the condensation of the man 
he was by no means ill looking quite the contrary 
his pure tight skin was an excellent fit  andclosely wrapped up in it  and embalmed with inner health and strength like a revivified egyptian  this starbuck seemed prepared to endure forlong ages to come  and to endure always  as now  for be it polar snowor torrid sun  like a patent chronometer  his interior vitality waswarranted to do well in all climates 
looking into his eyes  you seemedto see there the yet lingering images of those thousand fold perils hehad calmly confronted through life 
a staid  steadfast man  whose lifefor the most part was a telling pantomime of action  and not a tamechapter of sounds 
yet  for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude  therewere certain qualities in him which at times affected  and in somecases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest 
uncommonlyconscientious for a seaman  and endued with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly inclinehim to superstition  but to that sort of superstition  which in someorganizations seems rather to spring  somehow  from intelligence thanfrom ignorance 
outward portents and inward presentiments were his 
andif at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul  much moredid his far away domestic memories of his young cape wife and child tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature and open him still further to those latent influences which  in somehonest hearted men  restrain the gush of dare devil daring  so oftenevinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery 
 iwill have no man in my boat   said starbuck   who is not afraid of awhale   by this  he seemed to mean  not only that the most reliable anduseful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of theencountered peril  but that an utterly fearless man is a far moredangerous comrade than a coward  aye  aye   said stubb  the second mate   starbuck  there  is ascareful a man as you ll find anywhere in this fishery   but we shallere long see what that word  careful  precisely means when used by aman like stubb  or almost any other whale hunter starbuck was no crusader after perils  in him courage was not asentiment  but a thing simply useful to him  and always at hand uponall mortally practical occasions 
besides  he thought  perhaps  that inthis business of whaling  courage was one of the great staple outfitsof the ship  like her beef and her bread  and not to be foolishlywasted 
wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales aftersun down  nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persistedin fighting him 
for  thought starbuck  i am here in this criticalocean to kill whales for my living  and not to be killed by them fortheirs  and that hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knew what doom was his own father s 
where  in the bottomless deeps  couldhe find the torn limbs of his brother with memories like these in him  and  moreover  given to a certainsuperstitiousness  as has been said  the courage of this starbuck whichcould  nevertheless  still flourish  must indeed have been extreme 
butit was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized  and with suchterrible experiences and remembrances as he had  it was not in naturethat these things should fail in latently engendering an element inhim  which  under suitable circumstances  would break out from itsconfinement  and burn all his courage up 
and brave as he might be  itwas that sort of bravery chiefly  visible in some intrepid men  which while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas  or winds  orwhales  or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world  yetcannot withstand those more terrific  because more spiritual terrors which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enragedand mighty man but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance  the completeabasement of poor starbuck s fortitude  scarce might i have the heartto write it  for it is a thing most sorrowful  nay shocking  to exposethe fall of valour in the soul 
men may seem detestable as jointstock companies and nations  knaves  fools  and murderers there may be men may have mean and meagre faces  but man  in the ideal  is so nobleand so sparkling  such a grand and glowing creature  that over anyignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw theircostliest robes 
that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves  sofar within us  that it remains intact though all the outer characterseem gone  bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of avalor ruined man 
nor can piety itself  at such a shameful sight completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars 
butthis august dignity i treat of  is not the dignity of kings and robes but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture 
thou shaltsee it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike  thatdemocratic dignity which  on all hands  radiates without end from god himself 
the great god absolute 
the centre and circumference of alldemocracy 
his omnipresence  our divine equality if  then  to meanest mariners  and renegades and castaways  i shallhereafter ascribe high qualities  though dark  weave round them tragicgraces  if even the most mournful  perchance the most abased  amongthem all  shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts  if i shalltouch that workman s arm with some ethereal light  if i shall spread arainbow over his disastrous set of sun  then against all mortal criticsbear me out in it  thou just spirit of equality  which hast spread oneroyal mantle of humanity over all my kind

knights and squires stubb was the second mate 
he was a native of cape cod  and hence according to local usage  was called a cape cod man 
a happy go lucky neither craven nor valiant  taking perils as they came with anindifferent air  and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of thechase  toiling away  calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engagedfor the year 
good humored  easy  and careless  he presided over hiswhale boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner  and hiscrew all invited guests 
he was as particular about the comfortablearrangement of his part of the boat  as an old stage driver is aboutthe snugness of his box 
when close to the whale  in the verydeath lock of the fight  he handled his unpitying lance coolly andoff handedly  as a whistling tinker his hammer 
he would hum over hisold rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperatedmonster 
long usage had  for this stubb  converted the jaws of deathinto an easy chair

whether he ever thought of it at all  might be a question but  if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after acomfortable dinner  no doubt  like a good sailor  he took it to be asort of call of the watch to tumble aloft  and bestir themselves there about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order  andnot sooner what  perhaps  with other things  made stubb such an easy going unfearing man  so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in aworld full of grave pedlars  all bowed to the ground with their packs what helped to bring about that almost impious good humor of his  thatthing must have been his pipe 
for  like his nose  his short  blacklittle pipe was one of the regular features of his face 
you wouldalmost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without hisnose as without his pipe 
he kept a whole row of pipes there readyloaded  stuck in a rack  within easy reach of his hand  and  wheneverhe turned in  he smoked them all out in succession  lighting one fromthe other to the end of the chapter  then loading them again to be inreadiness anew 
for  when stubb dressed  instead of first putting hislegs into his trowsers  he put his pipe into his mouth i say this continual smoking must have been one cause  at least  of hispeculiar disposition  for every one knows that this earthly air whether ashore or afloat  is terribly infected with the namelessmiseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it  and as intime of the cholera  some people go about with a camphoratedhandkerchief to their mouths  so  likewise  against all mortaltribulations  stubb s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort ofdisinfecting agent the third mate was flask  a native of tisbury  in martha s vineyard 
ashort  stout  ruddy young fellow  very pugnacious concerning whales who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personallyand hereditarily affronted him  and therefore it was a sort of point ofhonor with him  to destroy them whenever encountered 
so utterly lostwas he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majesticbulk and mystic ways  and so dead to anything like an apprehension ofany possible danger from encountering them  that in his poor opinion the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse  or at leastwater rat  requiring only a little circumvention and some smallapplication of time and trouble in order to kill and boil 
thisignorant  unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish inthe matter of whales  he followed these fish for the fun of it  and athree years  voyage round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lastedthat length of time 
as a carpenter s nails are divided into wroughtnails and cut nails  so mankind may be similarly divided 
little flaskwas one of the wrought ones  made to clinch tight and last long 
theycalled him king post on board of the pequod  because  in form  he couldbe well likened to the short  square timber known by that name inarctic whalers  and which by the means of many radiating side timbersinserted into it  serves to brace the ship against the icy concussionsof those battering seas now these three mates starbuck  stubb  and flask  were momentous men they it was who by universal prescription commanded three of thepequod s boats as headsmen 
in that grand order of battle in whichcaptain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on thewhales  these three headsmen were as captains of companies 
or  beingarmed with their long keen whaling spears  they were as a picked trioof lancers  even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins and since in this famous fishery  each mate or headsman  like a gothicknight of old  is always accompanied by his boat steerer or harpooneer who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance  when theformer one has been badly twisted  or elbowed in the assault  andmoreover  as there generally subsists between the two  a close intimacyand friendliness  it is therefore but meet  that in this place we setdown who the pequod s harpooneers were  and to what headsman each ofthem belonged first of all was queequeg  whom starbuck  the chief mate  had selectedfor his squire 
but queequeg is already known next was tashtego  an unmixed indian from gay head  the most westerlypromontory of martha s vineyard  where there still exists the lastremnant of a village of red men  which has long supplied theneighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daringharpooneers 
in the fishery  they usually go by the generic name ofgay headers 
tashtego s long  lean  sable hair  his high cheek bones and black rounding eyes for an indian  oriental in their largeness  butantarctic in their glittering expression all this sufficientlyproclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proudwarrior hunters  who  in quest of the great new england moose  hadscoured  bow in hand  the aboriginal forests of the main 
but no longersnuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland  tashtego nowhunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea  the unerring harpoonof the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires 
to lookat the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs  you would almost havecredited the superstitions of some of the earlier puritans  andhalf believed this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the powersof the air 
tashtego was stubb the second mate s squire third among the harpooneers was daggoo  a gigantic  coal blacknegro savage  with a lion like tread an ahasuerus to behold 
suspendedfrom his ears were two golden hoops  so large that the sailors calledthem ring bolts  and would talk of securing the top sail halyards tothem 
in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler lying in a lonely bay on his native coast 
and never having beenanywhere in the world but in africa  nantucket  and the pagan harborsmost frequented by whalemen  and having now led for many years the boldlife of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of whatmanner of men they shipped  daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues and erect as a giraffe  moved about the decks in all the pomp of sixfeet five in his socks 
there was a corporeal humility in looking up athim  and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come tobeg truce of a fortress 
curious to tell  this imperial negro ahasuerus daggoo  was the squire of little flask  who looked like achess man beside him 
as for the residue of the pequod s company  be itsaid  that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand menbefore the mast employed in the american whale fishery  are americansborn  though pretty nearly all the officers are 
herein it is the samewith the american whale fishery as with the american army and militaryand merchant navies  and the engineering forces employed in theconstruction of the american canals and railroads 
the same  i say because in all these cases the native american liberally provides thebrains  the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles 
nosmall number of these whaling seamen belong to the azores  where theoutward bound nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crewsfrom the hardy peasants of those rocky shores 
in like manner  thegreenland whalers sailing out of hull or london  put in at the shetlandislands  to receive the full complement of their crew 
upon the passagehomewards  they drop them there again 
how it is  there is no telling but islanders seem to make the best whalemen 
they were nearly allislanders in the pequod  isolatoes too  i call such  notacknowledging the common continent of men  but each isolato living ona separate continent of his own 
yet now  federated along one keel what a set these isolatoes were 
an anacharsis clootz deputation fromall the isles of the sea  and all the ends of the earth  accompanyingold ahab in the pequod to lay the world s grievances before that barfrom which not very many of them ever come back 
black little pip henever did oh  no 
he went before 
poor alabama boy 
on the grimpequod s forecastle  ye shall ere long see him  beating his tambourine prelusive of the eternal time  when sent for  to the great quarter deckon high  he was bid strike in with angels  and beat his tambourine inglory  called a coward here  hailed a hero there chapter 28 
ahab for several days after leaving nantucket  nothing above hatches wasseen of captain ahab 
the mates regularly relieved each other at thewatches  and for aught that could be seen to the contrary  they seemedto be the only commanders of the ship  only they sometimes issued fromthe cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory  that after all it wasplain they but commanded vicariously 
yes  their supreme lord anddictator was there  though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted topenetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin every time i ascended to the deck from my watches below  i instantlygazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible  for my first vaguedisquietude touching the unknown captain  now in the seclusion of thesea  became almost a perturbation 
this was strangely heightened attimes by the ragged elijah s diabolical incoherences uninvitedlyrecurring to me  with a subtle energy i could not have before conceivedof 
but poorly could i withstand them  much as in other moods i wasalmost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandishprophet of the wharves 
but whatever it was of apprehensiveness oruneasiness to call it so which i felt  yet whenever i came to lookabout me in the ship  it seemed against all warrantry to cherish suchemotions 
for though the harpooneers  with the great body of the crew were a far more barbaric  heathenish  and motley set than any of thetame merchant ship companies which my previous experiences had made meacquainted with  still i ascribed this and rightly ascribed it to thefierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocationin which i had so abandonedly embarked 
but it was especially theaspect of the three chief officers of the ship  the mates  which wasmost forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings  andinduce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage three better  more likely sea officers and men  each in his owndifferent way  could not readily be found  and they were every one ofthem americans  a nantucketer  a vineyarder  a cape man 
now  it beingchristmas when the ship shot from out her harbor  for a space we hadbiting polar weather  though all the time running away from it to thesouthward  and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed gradually leaving that merciless winter  and all its intolerableweather behind us 
it was one of those less lowering  but still greyand gloomy enough mornings of the transition  when with a fair wind theship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leapingand melancholy rapidity  that as i mounted to the deck at the call ofthe forenoon watch  so soon as i levelled my glance towards thetaffrail  foreboding shivers ran over me 
reality outran apprehension captain ahab stood upon his quarter deck there seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him  nor of therecovery from any 
he looked like a man cut away from the stake  whenthe fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness 
hiswhole high  broad form  seemed made of solid bronze  and shaped in anunalterable mould  like cellini s cast perseus 
threading its way outfrom among his grey hairs  and continuing right down one side of histawny scorched face and neck  till it disappeared in his clothing  yousaw a slender rod like mark  lividly whitish 
it resembled thatperpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight  lofty trunk of agreat tree  when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it  andwithout wrenching a single twig  peels and grooves out the bark fromtop to bottom  ere running off into the soil  leaving the tree stillgreenly alive  but branded 
whether that mark was born with him  orwhether it was the scar left by some desperate wound  no one couldcertainly say 
by some tacit consent  throughout the voyage little orno allusion was made to it  especially by the mates 
but oncetashtego s senior  an old gay head indian among the crew superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old didahab become that way branded  and then it came upon him  not in thefury of any mortal fray  but in an elemental strife at sea 
yet  thiswild hint seemed inferentially negatived  by what a grey manxmaninsinuated  an old sepulchral man  who  having never before sailed outof nantucket  had never ere this laid eye upon wild ahab 
nevertheless the old sea traditions  the immemorial credulities  popularly investedthis old manxman with preternatural powers of discernment 
so that nowhite sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if evercaptain ahab should be tranquilly laid out which might hardly come topass  so he muttered then  whoever should do that last office for thedead  would find a birth mark on him from crown to sole so powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me  and thelivid brand which streaked it  that for the first few moments i hardlynoted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to thebarbaric white leg upon which he partly stood 
it had previously cometo me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polishedbone of the sperm whale s jaw 
 aye  he was dismasted off japan   saidthe old gay head indian once   but like his dismasted craft  he shippedanother mast without coming home for it 
he has a quiver of  em  i was struck with the singular posture he maintained 
upon each side ofthe pequod s quarter deck  and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds there was an auger hole  bored about half an inch or so  into theplank 
his bone leg steadied in that hole  one arm elevated  andholding by a shroud  captain ahab stood erect  looking straight outbeyond the ship s ever pitching prow 
there was an infinity of firmestfortitude  a determinate  unsurrenderable wilfulness  in the fixed andfearless  forward dedication of that glance 
not a word he spoke  nordid his officers say aught to him  though by all their minutestgestures and expressions  they plainly showed the uneasy  if notpainful  consciousness of being under a troubled master eye 
and notonly that  but moody stricken ahab stood before them with a crucifixionin his face  in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of somemighty woe ere long  from his first visit in the air  he withdrew into his cabin but after that morning  he was every day visible to the crew  eitherstanding in his pivot hole  or seated upon an ivory stool he had  orheavily walking the deck 
as the sky grew less gloomy  indeed  began togrow a little genial  he became still less and less a recluse  as if when the ship had sailed from home  nothing but the dead wintrybleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded 
and  by and by  itcame to pass  that he was almost continually in the air  but  as yet for all that he said  or perceptibly did  on the at last sunny deck  heseemed as unnecessary there as another mast 
but the pequod was onlymaking a passage now  not regularly cruising  nearly all whalingpreparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to  sothat there was little or nothing  out of himself  to employ or exciteahab  now  and thus chase away  for that one interval  the clouds thatlayer upon layer were piled upon his brow  as ever all clouds choosethe loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon nevertheless  ere long  the warm  warbling persuasiveness of thepleasant  holiday weather we came to  seemed gradually to charm himfrom his mood 
for  as when the red cheeked  dancing girls  april andmay  trip home to the wintry  misanthropic woods  even the barest ruggedest  most thunder cloven old oak will at least send forth somefew green sprouts  to welcome such glad hearted visitants  so ahab did in the end  a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlishair 
more than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look which  in any other man  would have soon flowered out in a smile chapter 29 
enter ahab  to him  stubb some days elapsed  and ice and icebergs all astern  the pequod now wentrolling through the bright quito spring  which  at sea  almostperpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal august of thetropic 
the warmly cool  clear  ringing  perfumed  overflowing redundant days  were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet  heapedup flaked up  with rose water snow 
the starred and stately nightsseemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets  nursing at home in lonelypride  the memory of their absent conquering earls  the golden helmetedsuns 
for sleeping man   twas hard to choose between such winsome daysand such seducing nights 
but all the witcheries of that unwaningweather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outwardworld 
inward they turned upon the soul  especially when the still mildhours of eve came on  then  memory shot her crystals as the clear icemost forms of noiseless twilights 
and all these subtle agencies  moreand more they wrought on ahab s texture old age is always wakeful  as if  the longer linked with life  the lessman has to do with aught that looks like death 
among sea commanders the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit thenight cloaked deck 
it was so with ahab  only that now  of late  heseemed so much to live in the open air  that truly speaking  his visitswere more to the cabin  than from the cabin to the planks 
 it feelslike going down into one s tomb   he would mutter to himself  for anold captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle  to go to mygrave dug berth  so  almost every twenty four hours  when the watches of the night wereset  and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle  the sailorsflung it not rudely down  as by day  but with some cautiousness droptit to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates  whenthis sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail  habitually  thesilent steersman would watch the cabin scuttle  and ere long the oldman would emerge  gripping at the iron banister  to help his crippledway 
some considering touch of humanity was in him  for at times likethese  he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter deck  becauseto his wearied mates  seeking repose within six inches of his ivoryheel  such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bonystep  that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth ofsharks 
but once  the mood was on him too deep for common regardings and as with heavy  lumber like pace he was measuring the ship fromtaffrail to mainmast  stubb  the old second mate  came up from below with a certain unassured  deprecating humorousness  hinted that ifcaptain ahab was pleased to walk the planks  then  no one could saynay  but there might be some way of muffling the noise  hintingsomething indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow  and theinsertion into it  of the ivory heel 
stubb  thou didst not knowahab then  am i a cannon ball  stubb   said ahab   that thou wouldst wad me thatfashion 
but go thy ways  i had forgot 
below to thy nightly grave where such as ye sleep between shrouds  to use ye to the filling one atlast  down  dog  and kennel  starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenlyscornful old man  stubb was speechless a moment  then said excitedly  i am not used to be spoken to that way  sir  i do but less than halflike it  sir   avast 
gritted ahab between his set teeth  and violently moving away as if to avoid some passionate temptation  no  sir  not yet   said stubb  emboldened   i will not tamely becalled a dog  sir   then be called ten times a donkey  and a mule  and an ass  and begone or i ll clear the world of thee  as he said this  ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrorsin his aspect  that stubb involuntarily retreated  i was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it  muttered stubb  as he found himself descending the cabin scuttle 
 it svery queer 
stop  stubb  somehow  now  i don t well know whether to goback and strike him  or what s that  down here on my knees and pray forhim 
yes  that was the thought coming up in me  but it would be thefirst time i ever did pray 
it s queer  very queer  and he s queertoo  aye  take him fore and aft  he s about the queerest old man stubbever sailed with 
how he flashed at me  his eyes like powder pans 
ishe mad 
anyway there s something on his mind  as sure as there must besomething on a deck when it cracks 
he aint in his bed now  either more than three hours out of the twenty four  and he don t sleep then didn t that dough boy  the steward  tell me that of a morning he alwaysfinds the old man s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled  and thesheets down at the foot  and the coverlid almost tied into knots  andthe pillow a sort of frightful hot  as though a baked brick had been onit 
a hot old man 
i guess he s got what some folks ashore call aconscience  it s a kind of tic dolly row they say worse nor atoothache 
well  well  i don t know what it is  but the lord keep mefrom catching it 
he s full of riddles  i wonder what he goes into theafter hold for  every night  as dough boy tells me he suspects  what sthat for  i should like to know 
who s made appointments with him inthe hold 
ain t that queer  now 
but there s no telling  it s the oldgame here goes for a snooze 
damn me  it s worth a fellow s while to beborn into the world  if only to fall right asleep 
and now that i thinkof it  that s about the first thing babies do  and that s a sort ofqueer  too 
damn me  but all things are queer  come to think of  em but that s against my principles 
think not  is my eleventhcommandment  and sleep when you can  is my twelfth so here goes again but how s that 
didn t he call me a dog 
he called me ten timesa donkey  and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that  he might aswell have kicked me  and done with it 
maybe he did kick me  and ididn t observe it  i was so taken all aback with his brow  somehow 
itflashed like a bleached bone 
what the devil s the matter with me 
idon t stand right on my legs 
coming afoul of that old man has a sortof turned me wrong side out 
by the lord  i must have been dreaming though how 
how  but the only way s to stash it  so here goes tohammock again  and in the morning  i ll see how this plaguey jugglingthinks over by daylight  chapter 30 
the pipe when stubb had departed  ahab stood for a while leaning over thebulwarks  and then  as had been usual with him of late  calling asailor of the watch  he sent him below for his ivory stool  and alsohis pipe 
lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stoolon the weather side of the deck  he sat and smoked in old norse times  the thrones of the sea loving danish kings werefabricated  saith tradition  of the tusks of the narwhale 
how couldone look at ahab then  seated on that tripod of bones  withoutbethinking him of the royalty it symbolized 
for a khan of the plank and a king of the sea  and a great lord of leviathans was ahab some moments passed  during which the thick vapor came from his mouthin quick and constant puffs  which blew back again into his face 
 hownow   he soliloquized at last  withdrawing the tube   this smoking nolonger soothes 
oh  my pipe 
hard must it go with me if thy charm begone 
here have i been unconsciously toiling  not pleasuring aye  andignorantly smoking to windward all the while  to windward  and withsuch nervous whiffs  as if  like the dying whale  my final jets werethe strongest and fullest of trouble 
what business have i with thispipe 
this thing that is meant for sereneness  to send up mild whitevapors among mild white hairs  not among torn iron grey locks likemine 
i ll smoke no more  he tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea 
the fire hissed in thewaves  the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipemade 
with slouched hat  ahab lurchingly paced the planks chapter 31 
queen mab next morning stubb accosted flask  such a queer dream  king post  i never had 
you know the old man sivory leg  well i dreamed he kicked me with it  and when i tried tokick back  upon my soul  my little man  i kicked my leg right off 
andthen  presto 
ahab seemed a pyramid  and i  like a blazing fool  keptkicking at it 
but what was still more curious  flask you know howcurious all dreams are through all this rage that i was in  i somehowseemed to be thinking to myself  that after all  it was not much of aninsult  that kick from ahab 
 why   thinks i   what s the row 
it s nota real leg  only a false leg   and there s a mighty difference betweena living thump and a dead thump 
that s what makes a blow from thehand  flask  fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane the living member that makes the living insult  my little man 
andthinks i to myself all the while  mind  while i was stubbing my sillytoes against that cursed pyramid so confoundedly contradictory was itall  all the while  i say  i was thinking to myself   what s his legnow  but a cane a whalebone cane 
yes   thinks i   it was only aplayful cudgelling in fact  only a whaleboning that he gave me not abase kick 
besides   thinks i   look at it once  why  the end of it thefoot part what a small sort of end it is  whereas  if a broad footedfarmer kicked me  there s a devilish broad insult 
but this insult iswhittled down to a point only   but now comes the greatest joke of thedream  flask 
while i was battering away at the pyramid  a sort ofbadger haired old merman  with a hump on his back  takes me by theshoulders  and slews me round 
 what are you  bout   says he 
slid man  but i was frightened 
such a phiz 
but  somehow  next moment i wasover the fright 
 what am i about   says i at last 
 and what businessis that of yours  i should like to know  mr  humpback 
do you want akick   by the lord  flask  i had no sooner said that  than he turnedround his stern to me  bent over  and dragging up a lot of seaweed hehad for a clout what do you think  i saw  why thunder alive  man  hisstern was stuck full of marlinspikes  with the points out 
says i  onsecond thoughts   i guess i won t kick you  old fellow    wise stubb  said he   wise stubb   and kept muttering it all the time  a sort ofeating of his own gums like a chimney hag 
seeing he wasn t going tostop saying over his  wise stubb  wise stubb   i thought i might aswell fall to kicking the pyramid again 
but i had only just lifted myfoot for it  when he roared out   stop that kicking    halloa   says i  what s the matter now  old fellow    look ye here   says he   let sargue the insult 
captain ahab kicked ye  didn t he    yes  he did  says i  right here it was    very good   says he  he used his ivoryleg  didn t he    yes  he did   says i 
 well then   says he   wisestubb  what have you to complain of 
didn t he kick with right goodwill 
it wasn t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with  was it 
no  youwere kicked by a great man  and with a beautiful ivory leg  stubb 
it san honor  i consider it an honor 
listen  wise stubb 
in old englandthe greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen  andmade garter knights of  but  be your boast  stubb  that ye werekicked by old ahab  and made a wise man of 
remember what i say  bekicked by him  account his kicks honors  and on no account kick back for you can t help yourself  wise stubb 
don t you see that pyramid  with that  he all of a sudden seemed somehow  in some queer fashion  toswim off into the air 
i snored  rolled over  and there i was in myhammock 
now  what do you think of that dream  flask   i don t know  it seems a sort of foolish to me  tho    may be  may be 
but it s made a wise man of me  flask 
d ye see ahabstanding there  sideways looking over the stern 
well  the best thingyou can do  flask  is to let the old man alone  never speak to him whatever he says 
what s that he shouts 
hark   mast head  there 
look sharp  all of ye 
there are whales hereabouts  if ye see a white one  split your lungs for him  what do you think of that now  flask 
ain t there a small drop ofsomething queer about that  eh 
a white whale did ye mark that  man look ye there s something special in the wind 
stand by for it  flask ahab has that that s bloody on his mind 
but  mum  he comes this way  chapter 32 
cetology already we are boldly launched upon the deep  but soon we shall be lostin its unshored  harbourless immensities 
ere that come to pass  erethe pequod s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls ofthe leviathan  at the outset it is but well to attend to a matteralmost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of themore special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts whichare to follow it is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera that i would now fain put before you 
yet is it no easy task 
theclassification of the constituents of a chaos  nothing less is hereessayed 
listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down  no branch of zoology is so much involved as that which is entitledcetology   says captain scoresby  a d  1820  it is not my intention  were it in my power  to enter into the inquiryas to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families 
      utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal  sperm whale   says surgeon beale  a d  1839  unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters   impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea    a fieldstrewn with thorns    all these incomplete indications but serve totorture us naturalists  thus speak of the whale  the great cuvier  and john hunter  and lesson those lights of zoology and anatomy 
nevertheless  though of realknowledge there be little  yet of books there are a plenty  and so insome small degree  with cetology  or the science of whales 
many arethe men  small and great  old and new  landsmen and seamen  who have atlarge or in little  written of the whale 
run over a few  the authorsof the bible  aristotle  pliny  aldrovandi  sir thomas browne  gesner ray  linnæus  rondeletius  willoughby  green  artedi  sibbald  brisson marten  lacépède  bonneterre  desmarest  baron cuvier  frederickcuvier  john hunter  owen  scoresby  beale  bennett  j  ross browne the author of miriam coffin  olmstead  and the rev 
t  cheever 
but towhat ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written  the abovecited extracts will show of the names in this list of whale authors  only those following owenever saw living whales  and but one of them was a real professionalharpooneer and whaleman 
i mean captain scoresby 
on the separatesubject of the greenland or right whale  he is the best existingauthority 
but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the greatsperm whale  compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthymentioning 
and here be it said  that the greenland whale is an usurperupon the throne of the seas 
he is not even by any means the largest ofthe whales 
yet  owing to the long priority of his claims  and theprofound ignorance which  till some seventy years back  invested thethen fabulous or utterly unknown sperm whale  and which ignorance tothis present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreatsand whale ports  this usurpation has been every way complete 
referenceto nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of pastdays  will satisfy you that the greenland whale  without one rival  wasto them the monarch of the seas 
but the time has at last come for anew proclamation 
this is charing cross  hear ye 
good people all  thegreenland whale is deposed  the great sperm whale now reigneth there are only two books in being which at all pretend to put theliving sperm whale before you  and at the same time  in the remotestdegree succeed in the attempt 
those books are beale s and bennett s both in their time surgeons to english south sea whale ships  and bothexact and reliable men 
the original matter touching the sperm whale tobe found in their volumes is necessarily small  but so far as it goes it is of excellent quality  though mostly confined to scientificdescription 
as yet  however  the sperm whale  scientific or poetic lives not complete in any literature 
far above all other huntedwhales  his is an unwritten life now the various species of whales need some sort of popularcomprehensive classification  if only an easy outline one for thepresent  hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequentlaborers 
as no better man advances to take this matter in hand  ihereupon offer my own poor endeavors 
i promise nothing complete because any human thing supposed to be complete  must for that veryreason infallibly be faulty 
i shall not pretend to a minute anatomicaldescription of the various species  or in this place at least to muchof any description 
my object here is simply to project the draught ofa systematization of cetology 
i am the architect  not the builder but it is a ponderous task  no ordinary letter sorter in thepost office is equal to it 
to grope down into the bottom of the seaafter them  to have one s hands among the unspeakable foundations ribs  and very pelvis of the world  this is a fearful thing 
what am ithat i should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan 
the awfultauntings in job might well appal me 
will he  the leviathan  make acovenant with thee 
behold the hope of him is vain 
but i have swamthrough libraries and sailed through oceans  i have had to do withwhales with these visible hands  i am in earnest  and i will try 
thereare some preliminaries to settle first  the uncertain  unsettled condition of this science of cetologyis in the very vestibule attested by the fact  that in some quarters itstill remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish 
in his system ofnature  a d  1776  linnæus declares   i hereby separate the whales fromthe fish   but of my own knowledge  i know that down to the year 1850 sharks and shad  alewives and herring  against linnæus s express edict were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with theleviathan the grounds upon which linnæus would fain have banished the whales fromthe waters  he states as follows   on account of their warm bilocularheart  their lungs  their movable eyelids  their hollow ears  penemintrantem feminam mammis lactantem   and finally   ex lege naturæ juremeritoque   i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charleycoffin  of nantucket  both messmates of mine in a certain voyage  andthey united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogetherinsufficient 
charley profanely hinted they were humbug be it known that  waiving all argument  i take the good old fashionedground that the whale is a fish  and call upon holy jonah to back me this fundamental thing settled  the next point is  in what internalrespect does the whale differ from other fish 
above  linnæus has givenyou those items 
but in brief  they are these  lungs and warm blood whereas  all other fish are lungless and cold blooded next  how shall we define the whale  by his obvious externals  so asconspicuously to label him for all time to come 
to be short  then  awhale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail 
there you have him however contracted  that definition is the result of expandedmeditation 
a walrus spouts much like a whale  but the walrus is not afish  because he is amphibious 
but the last term of the definition isstill more cogent  as coupled with the first 
almost any one must havenoticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat  but avertical  or up and down tail 
whereas  among spouting fish the tail though it may be similarly shaped  invariably assumes a horizontalposition by the above definition of what a whale is  i do by no means excludefrom the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identifiedwith the whale by the best informed nantucketers  nor  on the otherhand  link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded asalien 
  hence  all the smaller  spouting  and horizontal tailed fishmust be included in this ground plan of cetology 
now  then  come thegrand divisions of the entire whale host 
 i am aware that down to the present time  the fish styled lamatins anddugongs  pig fish and sow fish of the coffins of nantucket  areincluded by many naturalists among the whales 
but as these pig fishare a noisy  contemptible set  mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers and feeding on wet hay  and especially as they do not spout  i denytheir credentials as whales  and have presented them with theirpassports to quit the kingdom of cetology first  according to magnitude i divide the whales into three primarybooks  subdivisible into chapters   and these shall comprehend themall  both small and large i 
the folio whale  ii 
the octavo whale  iii 
the duodecimo whale as the type of the folio i present the sperm whale  of the octavo the grampus  of the duodecimo  the porpoise folios 
among these i here include the following chapters  i

the fin back whale  iv the hump backed whale  v  the razor back whale  vi 
the sulphurbottom whale book i 
 folio   chapter i 
 sperm whale   this whale  among theenglish of old vaguely known as the trumpa whale  and the physeterwhale  and the anvil headed whale  is the present cachalot of thefrench  and the pottsfich of the germans  and the macrocephalus of thelong words 
he is  without doubt  the largest inhabitant of the globe the most formidable of all whales to encounter  the most majestic inaspect  and lastly  by far the most valuable in commerce  he being theonly creature from which that valuable substance  spermaceti  isobtained 
all his peculiarities will  in many other places  be enlargedupon 
it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do 
philologicallyconsidered  it is absurd 
some centuries ago  when the sperm whale wasalmost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality  and when his oilwas only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish  in those daysspermaceti  it would seem  was popularly supposed to be derived from acreature identical with the one then known in england as the greenlandor right whale 
it was the idea also  that this same spermaceti wasthat quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllableof the word literally expresses 
in those times  also  spermaceti wasexceedingly scarce  not being used for light  but only as an ointmentand medicament 
it was only to be had from the druggists as younowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb 
when  as i opine  in the course oftime  the true nature of spermaceti became known  its original name wasstill retained by the dealers  no doubt to enhance its value by anotion so strangely significant of its scarcity 
and so the appellationmust at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which thisspermaceti was really derived book i 
 folio   chapter ii 
 right whale   in one respect this isthe most venerable of the leviathans  being the one first regularlyhunted by man 
it yields the article commonly known as whalebone orbaleen  and the oil specially known as  whale oil   an inferior articlein commerce 
among the fishermen  he is indiscriminately designated byall the following titles  the whale  the greenland whale  the blackwhale  the great whale  the true whale  the right whale 
there is adeal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thusmultitudinously baptised 
what then is the whale  which i include inthe second species of my folios 
it is the great mysticetus of theenglish naturalists  the greenland whale of the english whalemen  thebaleine ordinaire of the french whalemen  the growlands walfish of theswedes 
it is the whale which for more than two centuries past has beenhunted by the dutch and english in the arctic seas  it is the whalewhich the american fishermen have long pursued in the indian ocean  onthe brazil banks  on the nor  west coast  and various other parts ofthe world  designated by them right whale cruising grounds some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of theenglish and the right whale of the americans 
but they precisely agreein all their grand features  nor has there yet been presented a singledeterminate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction 
it is byendless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences  thatsome departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate the right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length  withreference to elucidating the sperm whale book i 
 folio   chapter iii 
 fin back   under this head i reckona monster which  by the various names of fin back  tall spout  andlong john  has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whalewhose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing theatlantic  in the new york packet tracks 
in the length he attains  andin his baleen  the fin back resembles the right whale  but is of a lessportly girth  and a lighter colour  approaching to olive 
his greatlips present a cable like aspect  formed by the intertwisting  slantingfolds of large wrinkles 
his grand distinguishing feature  the fin from which he derives his name  is often a conspicuous object 
this finis some three or four feet long  growing vertically from the hinderpart of the back  of an angular shape  and with a very sharp pointedend 
even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible this isolated fin will  at times  be seen plainly projecting from thesurface 
when the sea is moderately calm  and slightly marked withspherical ripples  and this gnomon like fin stands up and casts shadowsupon the wrinkled surface  it may well be supposed that the waterycircle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial  with its style andwavy hour lines graved on it 
on that ahaz dial the shadow often goesback 
the fin back is not gregarious 
he seems a whale hater  as somemen are man haters 
very shy  always going solitary  unexpectedlyrising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters  hisstraight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spearupon a barren plain  gifted with such wondrous power and velocity inswimming  as to defy all present pursuit from man  this leviathan seemsthe banished and unconquerable cain of his race  bearing for his markthat style upon his back 
from having the baleen in his mouth  thefin back is sometimes included with the right whale  among a theoreticspecies denominated whalebone whales  that is  whales with baleen 
ofthese so called whalebone whales  there would seem to be severalvarieties  most of which  however  are little known 
broad nosed whalesand beaked whales  pike headed whales  bunched whales  under jawedwhales and rostrated whales  are the fishermen s names for a few sorts in connection with this appellative of  whalebone whales   it is ofgreat importance to mention  that however such a nomenclature may beconvenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales  yet it isin vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan  foundedupon either his baleen  or hump  or fin  or teeth  notwithstanding thatthose marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted toafford the basis for a regular system of cetology than any otherdetached bodily distinctions  which the whale  in his kinds  presents how then 
the baleen  hump  back fin  and teeth  these are things whosepeculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure inother and more essential particulars 
thus  the sperm whale and thehumpbacked whale  each has a hump  but there the similitude ceases then  this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale  each of thesehas baleen  but there again the similitude ceases 
and it is just thesame with the other parts above mentioned 
in various sorts of whales they form such irregular combinations  or  in the case of any one ofthem detached  such an irregular isolation  as utterly to defy allgeneral methodization formed upon such a basis 
on this rock every oneof the whale naturalists has split but it may possibly be conceived that  in the internal parts of thewhale  in his anatomy there  at least  we shall be able to hit theright classification 
nay  what thing  for example  is there in thegreenland whale s anatomy more striking than his baleen 
yet we haveseen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify thegreenland whale 
and if you descend into the bowels of the variousleviathans  why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part asavailable to the systematizer as those external ones alreadyenumerated 
what then remains 
nothing but to take hold of the whalesbodily  in their entire liberal volume  and boldly sort them that way and this is the bibliographical system here adopted  and it is the onlyone that can possibly succeed  for it alone is practicable 
to proceed book i 
 folio  chapter iv 
 hump back   this whale is often seenon the northern american coast 
he has been frequently captured there and towed into harbor 
he has a great pack on him like a peddler  oryou might call him the elephant and castle whale 
at any rate  thepopular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him  since thesperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one 
his oil is not veryvaluable 
he has baleen 
he is the most gamesome and light hearted ofall the whales  making more gay foam and white water generally than anyother of them book i 
 folio   chapter v   razor back   of this whale little isknown but his name 
i have seen him at a distance off cape horn 
of aretiring nature  he eludes both hunters and philosophers 
though nocoward  he has never yet shown any part of him but his back  whichrises in a long sharp ridge 
let him go 
i know little more of him  nordoes anybody else book i 
 folio   chapter vi 
 sulphur bottom   another retiringgentleman  with a brimstone belly  doubtless got by scraping along thetartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings 
he is seldom seen at least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas  andthen always at too great a distance to study his countenance 
he isnever chased  he would run away with rope walks of line 
prodigies aretold of him 
adieu  sulphur bottom 
i can say nothing more that is trueof ye  nor can the oldest nantucketer thus ends book i 
 folio   and now begins book ii 
  these embrace the whales of middling magnitude  among whichpresent may be numbered  i   the grampus  ii   the black fish iii   the narwhale  iv   the thrasher  v   the killer 
 why this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain because  while the whales of this order  though smaller than those ofthe former order  nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to themin figure  yet the bookbinder s quarto volume in its dimensioned formdoes not preserve the shape of the folio volume  but the octavo volumedoes book ii 
 octavo   chapter i 
 grampus   though this fish  whoseloud sonorous breathing  or rather blowing  has furnished a proverb tolandsmen  is so well known a denizen of the deep  yet is he notpopularly classed among whales 
but possessing all the granddistinctive features of the leviathan  most naturalists have recognisedhim for one 
he is of moderate octavo size  varying from fifteen totwenty five feet in length  and of corresponding dimensions round thewaist 
he swims in herds  he is never regularly hunted  though his oilis considerable in quantity  and pretty good for light 
by somefishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of thegreat sperm whale book ii 
 octavo   chapter ii 
 black fish   i give the popularfishermen s names for all these fish  for generally they are the best where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive  i shall say so  andsuggest another 
i do so now  touching the black fish  so called because blackness is the rule among almost all whales 
so  call him thehyena whale  if you please 
his voracity is well known  and from thecircumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards  hecarries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face 
this whaleaverages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length 
he is found in almostall latitudes 
he has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked finin swimming  which looks something like a roman nose 
when not moreprofitably employed  the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture thehyena whale  to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domesticemployment as some frugal housekeepers  in the absence of company  andquite alone by themselves  burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax though their blubber is very thin  some of these whales will yield youupwards of thirty gallons of oil book ii 
 octavo   chapter iii 
 narwhale   that is  nostrilwhale  another instance of a curiously named whale  so named i supposefrom his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose 
thecreature is some sixteen feet in length  while its horn averages fivefeet  though some exceed ten  and even attain to fifteen feet 
strictlyspeaking  this horn is but a lengthened tusk  growing out from the jawin a line a little depressed from the horizontal 
but it is only foundon the sinister side  which has an ill effect  giving its ownersomething analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left handed man 
whatprecise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers  it would be hard tosay 
it does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword fish andbill fish  though some sailors tell me that the narwhale employs it fora rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food 
charley coffinsaid it was used for an ice piercer  for the narwhale  rising to thesurface of the polar sea  and finding it sheeted with ice  thrusts hishorn up  and so breaks through 
but you cannot prove either of thesesurmises to be correct 
my own opinion is  that however this one sidedhorn may really be used by the narwhale however that may be it wouldcertainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale  the horned whale and the unicorn whale 
he is certainly a curious example of theunicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature 
fromcertain cloistered old authors i have gathered that this samesea unicorn s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidoteagainst poison  and as such  preparations of it brought immense prices it was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies  the sameway that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity black letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his return from thatvoyage  when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to himfrom a window of greenwich palace  as his bold ship sailed down thethames   when sir martin returned from that voyage   saith blackletter   on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious longhorn of the narwhale  which for a long period after hung in the castleat windsor   an irish author avers that the earl of leicester  onbended knees  did likewise present to her highness another horn pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature the narwhale has a very picturesque  leopard like look  being of amilk white ground colour  dotted with round and oblong spots of black his oil is very superior  clear and fine  but there is little of it and he is seldom hunted 
he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas book ii 
 octavo   chapter iv 
 killer   of this whale little isprecisely known to the nantucketer  and nothing at all to the professednaturalist 
from what i have seen of him at a distance  i should saythat he was about the bigness of a grampus 
he is very savage a sort offeegee fish 
he sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip  andhangs there like a leech  till the mighty brute is worried to death the killer is never hunted 
i never heard what sort of oil he has exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale  on theground of its indistinctness 
for we are all killers  on land and onsea  bonapartes and sharks included book ii 
 octavo   chapter v   thrasher   this gentleman is famousfor his tail  which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes 
hemounts the folio whale s back  and as he swims  he works his passage byflogging him  as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similarprocess 
still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer 
bothare outlaws  even in the lawless seas 
thus ends book ii 
 octavo   and begins book iii 
 duodecimo  duodecimoes  these include the smaller whales 
the huzza porpoise ii 
the algerine porpoise 
the mealy mouthed porpoise to those who have not chanced specially to study the subject  it maypossibly seem strange  that fishes not commonly exceeding four or fivefeet should be marshalled among whales a word  which  in the popularsense  always conveys an idea of hugeness 
but the creatures set downabove as duodecimoes are infallibly whales  by the terms of mydefinition of what a whale is i e  a spouting fish  with a horizontaltail book iii 
 duodecimo   chapter 1 
 huzza porpoise   this is thecommon porpoise found almost all over the globe 
the name is of my ownbestowal  for there are more than one sort of porpoises  and somethingmust be done to distinguish them 
i call him thus  because he alwaysswims in hilarious shoals  which upon the broad sea keep tossingthemselves to heaven like caps in a fourth of july crowd 
theirappearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner 
full offine spirits  they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward they are the lads that always live before the wind 
they are accounteda lucky omen 
if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholdingthese vivacious fish  then heaven help ye  the spirit of godlygamesomeness is not in ye 
a well fed  plump huzza porpoise will yieldyou one good gallon of good oil 
but the fine and delicate fluidextracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable 
it is in request amongjewellers and watchmakers 
sailors put it on their hones 
porpoise meatis good eating  you know 
it may never have occurred to you that aporpoise spouts 
indeed  his spout is so small that it is not veryreadily discernible 
but the next time you have a chance  watch him and you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniature book iii 
 duodecimo   chapter ii 
 algerine porpoise   a pirate very savage 
he is only found  i think  in the pacific 
he is somewhatlarger than the huzza porpoise  but much of the same general make provoke him  and he will buckle to a shark 
i have lowered for him manytimes  but never yet saw him captured book iii 
 duodecimo   chapter iii 
 mealy mouthed porpoise   thelargest kind of porpoise  and only found in the pacific  so far as itis known 
the only english name  by which he has hitherto beendesignated  is that of the fishers right whale porpoise  from thecircumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio 
inshape  he differs in some degree from the huzza porpoise  being of aless rotund and jolly girth  indeed  he is of quite a neat andgentleman like figure 
he has no fins on his back  most other porpoiseshave   he has a lovely tail  and sentimental indian eyes of a hazelhue 
but his mealy mouth spoils all 
though his entire back down to hisside fins is of a deep sable  yet a boundary line  distinct as the markin a ship s hull  called the  bright waist   that line streaks him fromstem to stern  with two separate colours  black above and white below the white comprises part of his head  and the whole of his mouth  whichmakes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to ameal bag 
a most mean and mealy aspect 
his oil is much like that ofthe common porpoise 
           beyond the duodecimo  this system does not proceed  inasmuch as theporpoise is the smallest of the whales 
above  you have all theleviathans of note 
but there are a rabble of uncertain  fugitive half fabulous whales  which  as an american whaleman  i know byreputation  but not personally 
i shall enumerate them by theirfore castle appellations  for possibly such a list may be valuable tofuture investigators  who may complete what i have here but begun 
ifany of the following whales  shall hereafter be caught and marked  thenhe can readily be incorporated into this system  according to hisfolio  octavo  or duodecimo magnitude  the bottle nose whale  the junkwhale  the pudding headed whale  the cape whale  the leading whale  thecannon whale  the scragg whale  the coppered whale  the elephant whale the iceberg whale  the quog whale  the blue whale  etc 
from icelandic dutch  and old english authorities  there might be quoted other listsof uncertain whales  blessed with all manner of uncouth names 
but iomit them as altogether obsolete  and can hardly help suspecting themfor mere sounds  full of leviathanism  but signifying nothing finally  it was stated at the outset  that this system would not behere  and at once  perfected 
you cannot but plainly see that i havekept my word 
but i now leave my cetological system standing thusunfinished  even as the great cathedral of cologne was left  with thecrane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower 
for smallerections may be finished by their first architects  grand ones  trueones  ever leave the copestone to posterity 
god keep me from evercompleting anything 
this whole book is but a draught nay  but thedraught of a draught 
oh  time  strength  cash  and patience chapter 33 
the specksnyder concerning the officers of the whale craft  this seems as good a placeas any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship board  arisingfrom the existence of the harpooneer class of officers  a class unknownof course in any other marine than the whale fleet the large importance attached to the harpooneer s vocation is evincedby the fact  that originally in the old dutch fishery  two centuriesand more ago  the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in theperson now called the captain  but was divided between him and anofficer called the specksnyder 
literally this word means fat cutter usage  however  in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer 
inthose days  the captain s authority was restricted to the navigationand general management of the vessel  while over the whale huntingdepartment and all its concerns  the specksnyder or chief harpooneerreigned supreme 
in the british greenland fishery  under the corruptedtitle of specksioneer  this old dutch official is still retained  buthis former dignity is sadly abridged 
at present he ranks simply assenior harpooneer  and as such  is but one of the captain s moreinferior subalterns 
nevertheless  as upon the good conduct of theharpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends  and sincein the american fishery he is not only an important officer in theboat  but under certain circumstances  night watches on a whalingground  the command of the ship s deck is also his  therefore the grandpolitical maxim of the sea demands  that he should nominally live apartfrom the men before the mast  and be in some way distinguished as theirprofessional superior  though always  by them  familiarly regarded astheir social equal now  the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea  isthis the first lives aft  the last forward 
hence  in whale ships andmerchantmen alike  the mates have their quarters with the captain  andso  too  in most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged inthe after part of the ship 
that is to say  they take their meals inthe captain s cabin  and sleep in a place indirectly communicating withit though the long period of a southern whaling voyage  by far the longestof all voyages now or ever made by man   the peculiar perils of it  andthe community of interest prevailing among a company  all of whom  highor low  depend for their profits  not upon fixed wages  but upon theircommon luck  together with their common vigilance  intrepidity  andhard work  though all these things do in some cases tend to beget aless rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally  yet  never mindhow much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may  in someprimitive instances  live together  for all that  the punctiliousexternals  at least  of the quarter deck are seldom materially relaxed and in no instance done away 
indeed  many are the nantucket ships inwhich you will see the skipper parading his quarter deck with an elatedgrandeur not surpassed in any military navy  nay  extorting almost asmuch outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple  and not theshabbiest of pilot cloth and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the leastgiven to that sort of shallowest assumption  and though the only homagehe ever exacted  was implicit  instantaneous obedience  though herequired no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon thequarter deck  and though there were times when  owing to peculiarcircumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed  headdressed them in unusual terms  whether of condescension or interrorem  or otherwise  yet even captain ahab was by no meansunobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea nor  perhaps  will it fail to be eventually perceived  that behindthose forms and usages  as it were  he sometimes masked himself incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends thanthey were legitimately intended to subserve 
that certain sultanism ofhis brain  which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in anirresistible dictatorship 
for be a man s intellectual superiority whatit will  it can never assume the practical  available supremacy overother men  without the aid of some sort of external arts andentrenchments  always  in themselves  more or less paltry and base this it is  that for ever keeps god s true princes of the empire fromthe world s hustings  and leaves the highest honors that this air cangive  to those men who become famous more through their infiniteinferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert  thanthrough their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme politicalsuperstitions invest them  that in some royal instances even to idiotimbecility they have imparted potency 
but when  as in the case ofnicholas the czar  the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles animperial brain  then  the plebeian herds crouch abased before thetremendous centralization 
nor  will the tragic dramatist who woulddepict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint  incidentally so important in his art  as the onenow alluded to but ahab  my captain  still moves before me in all his nantucketgrimness and shagginess  and in this episode touching emperors andkings  i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor oldwhale hunter like him  and  therefore  all outward majestical trappingsand housings are denied me 
oh  ahab 
what shall be grand in thee  itmust needs be plucked at from the skies  and dived for in the deep  andfeatured in the unbodied air chapter 34 
the cabin table it is noon  and dough boy  the steward  thrusting his paleloaf of bread face from the cabin scuttle  announces dinner to his lordand master  who  sitting in the lee quarter boat  has just been takingan observation of the sun  and is now mutely reckoning the latitude onthe smooth  medallion shaped tablet  reserved for that daily purpose onthe upper part of his ivory leg 
from his complete inattention to thetidings  you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial 
butpresently  catching hold of the mizen shrouds  he swings himself to thedeck  and in an even  unexhilarated voice  saying   dinner  mr starbuck   disappears into the cabin when the last echo of his sultan s step has died away  and starbuck the first emir  has every reason to suppose that he is seated  thenstarbuck rouses from his quietude  takes a few turns along the planks and  after a grave peep into the binnacle  says  with some touch ofpleasantness   dinner  mr  stubb   and descends the scuttle 
the secondemir lounges about the rigging awhile  and then slightly shaking themain brace  to see whether it will be all right with that importantrope  he likewise takes up the old burden  and with a rapid  dinner mr 
flask   follows after his predecessors but the third emir  now seeing himself all alone on the quarter deck seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint  for  tipping allsorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions  and kicking off hisshoes  he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe rightover the grand turk s head  and then  by a dexterous sleight  pitchinghis cap up into the mizentop for a shelf  he goes down rollicking sofar at least as he remains visible from the deck  reversing all otherprocessions  by bringing up the rear with music 
but ere stepping intothe cabin doorway below  he pauses  ships a new face altogether  and then  independent  hilarious little flask enters king ahab s presence in the character of abjectus  or the slave it is not the least among the strange things bred by the intenseartificialness of sea usages  that while in the open air of the decksome officers will  upon provocation  bear themselves boldly anddefyingly enough towards their commander  yet  ten to one  let thosevery officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in thatsame commander s cabin  and straightway their inoffensive  not to saydeprecatory and humble air towards him  as he sits at the head of thetable  this is marvellous  sometimes most comical 
wherefore thisdifference 
a problem 
perhaps not 
to have been belshazzar  king ofbabylon  and to have been belshazzar  not haughtily but courteously therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur 
but hewho in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his ownprivate dinner table of invited guests  that man s unchallenged powerand dominion of individual influence for the time  that man s royaltyof state transcends belshazzar s  for belshazzar was not the greatest who has but once dined his friends  has tasted what it is to be cæsar it is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding now  if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of aship master  then  by inference  you will derive the cause of thatpeculiarity of sea life just mentioned over his ivory inlaid table  ahab presided like a mute  maned sea lionon the white coral beach  surrounded by his warlike but stilldeferential cubs 
in his own proper turn  each officer waited to beserved 
they were as little children before ahab  and yet  in ahab there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance 
with one mind their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man s knife  as he carvedthe chief dish before him 
i do not suppose that for the world theywould have profaned that moment with the slightest observation  evenupon so neutral a topic as the weather 
and when reaching out hisknife and fork  between which the slice of beef was locked  ahabthereby motioned starbuck s plate towards him  the mate received hismeat as though receiving alms  and cut it tenderly  and a littlestarted if  perchance  the knife grazed against the plate  and chewedit noiselessly  and swallowed it  not without circumspection 
for  likethe coronation banquet at frankfort  where the german emperorprofoundly dines with the seven imperial electors  so these cabin mealswere somehow solemn meals  eaten in awful silence  and yet at table oldahab forbade not conversation  only he himself was dumb 
what a reliefit was to choking stubb  when a rat made a sudden racket in the holdbelow 
and poor little flask  he was the youngest son  and little boyof this weary family party 
his were the shinbones of the saline beef his would have been the drumsticks 
for flask to have presumed to helphimself  this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in thefirst degree 
had he helped himself at that table  doubtless  nevermore would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless  strange to say  ahab never forbade him 
and had flaskhelped himself  the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it least of all  did flask presume to help himself to butter 
whether hethought the owners of the ship denied it to him  on account of itsclotting his clear  sunny complexion  or whether he deemed that  on solong a voyage in such marketless waters  butter was at a premium  andtherefore was not for him  a subaltern  however it was  flask  alas was a butterless man another thing 
flask was the last person down at the dinner  and flaskis the first man up 
for hereby flask s dinner was badlyjammed in point of time 
starbuck and stubb both had the start of him and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear 
if stubbeven  who is but a peg higher than flask  happens to have but a smallappetite  and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast  then flaskmust bestir himself  he will not get more than three mouthfuls thatday  for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to thedeck 
therefore it was that flask once admitted in private  that eversince he had arisen to the dignity of an officer  from that moment hehad never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry  more or less for what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger  as keep it immortalin him 
peace and satisfaction  thought flask  have for ever departedfrom my stomach 
i am an officer  but  how i wish i could fish a bit ofold fashioned beef in the forecastle  as i used to when i was beforethe mast 
there s the fruits of promotion now  there s the vanity ofglory  there s the insanity of life 
besides  if it were so that anymere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flask sofficial capacity  all that sailor had to do  in order to obtain amplevengeance  was to go aft at dinner time  and get a peep at flaskthrough the cabin sky light  sitting silly and dumfoundered beforeawful ahab now  ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first tablein the pequod s cabin 
after their departure  taking place in invertedorder to their arrival  the canvas cloth was cleared  or rather wasrestored to some hurried order by the pallid steward 
and then thethree harpooneers were bidden to the feast  they being its residuarylegatees 
they made a sort of temporary servants  hall of the high andmighty cabin in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and namelessinvisible domineerings of the captain s table  was the entire care freelicense and ease  the almost frantic democracy of those inferiorfellows the harpooneers 
while their masters  the mates  seemed afraidof the sound of the hinges of their own jaws  the harpooneers chewedtheir food with such a relish that there was a report to it 
they dinedlike lords  they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loadingwith spices 
such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego  thatto fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast  often the paledough boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt junk  seeminglyquarried out of the solid ox 
and if he were not lively about it  if hedid not go with a nimble hop skip and jump  then tashtego had anungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back harpoon wise 
and once daggoo  seized with a sudden humor  assisteddough boy s memory by snatching him up bodily  and thrusting his headinto a great empty wooden trencher  while tashtego  knife in hand began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him 
he wasnaturally a very nervous  shuddering sort of little fellow  thisbread faced steward  the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospitalnurse 
and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages dough boy s whole life was one continual lip quiver 
commonly  afterseeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded  hewould escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining  andfearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door  till all wasover it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego  opposinghis filed teeth to the indian s  crosswise to them  daggoo seated onthe floor  for a bench would have brought his hearse plumed head to thelow carlines  at every motion of his colossal limbs  making the lowcabin framework to shake  as when an african elephant goes passenger ina ship 
but for all this  the great negro was wonderfully abstemious not to say dainty 
it seemed hardly possible that by such comparativelysmall mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through sobroad  baronial  and superb a person 
but  doubtless  this noble savagefed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air  and throughhis dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds 
not bybeef or by bread  are giants made or nourished 
but queequeg  he had amortal  barbaric smack of the lip in eating an ugly sound enough somuch so  that the trembling dough boy almost looked to see whether anymarks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms 
and when he would heartashtego singing out for him to produce himself  that his bones mightbe picked  the simple witted steward all but shattered the crockeryhanging round him in the pantry  by his sudden fits of the palsy 
nordid the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets  fortheir lances and other weapons  and with which whetstones  at dinner they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives  that grating sound didnot at all tend to tranquillize poor dough boy 
how could he forgetthat in his island days  queequeg  for one  must certainly have beenguilty of some murderous  convivial indiscretions 
dough boy hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals 
not a napkinshould he carry on his arm  but a buckler 
in good time  though  to hisgreat delight  the three salt sea warriors would rise and depart  tohis credulous  fable mongering ears  all their martial bones jinglingin them at every step  like moorish scimetars in scabbards but  though these barbarians dined in the cabin  and nominally livedthere  still  being anything but sedentary in their habits  they werescarcely ever in it except at mealtimes  and just before sleeping time when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters in this one matter  ahab seemed no exception to most american whalecaptains  who  as a set  rather incline to the opinion that by rightsthe ship s cabin belongs to them  and that it is by courtesy alone thatanybody else is  at any time  permitted there 
so that  in real truth the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said tohave lived out of the cabin than in it 
for when they did enter it  itwas something as a street door enters a house  turning inwards for amoment  only to be turned out the next  and  as a permanent thing residing in the open air 
nor did they lose much hereby  in the cabinwas no companionship  socially  ahab was inaccessible 
though nominallyincluded in the census of christendom  he was still an alien to it 
helived in the world  as the last of the grisly bears lived in settledmissouri 
and as when spring and summer had departed  that wild loganof the woods  burying himself in the hollow of a tree  lived out thewinter there  sucking his own paws  so  in his inclement  howling oldage  ahab s soul  shut up in the caved trunk of his body  there fedupon the sullen paws of its gloom chapter 35 
the mast head it was during the more pleasant weather  that in due rotation with theother seamen my first mast head came round in most american whalemen the mast heads are manned almostsimultaneously with the vessel s leaving her port  even though she mayhave fifteen thousand miles  and more  to sail ere reaching her propercruising ground 
and if  after a three  four  or five years  voyage sheis drawing nigh home with anything empty in her say  an empty vialeven then  her mast heads are kept manned to the last  and not till herskysail poles sail in among the spires of the port  does she altogetherrelinquish the hope of capturing one whale more now  as the business of standing mast heads  ashore or afloat  is avery ancient and interesting one  let us in some measure expatiatehere 
i take it  that the earliest standers of mast heads were the oldegyptians  because  in all my researches  i find none prior to them for though their progenitors  the builders of babel  must doubtless  bytheir tower  have intended to rear the loftiest mast head in all asia or africa either  yet  ere the final truck was put to it  as that greatstone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board  in thedread gale of god s wrath  therefore  we cannot give these babelbuilders priority over the egyptians 
and that the egyptians were anation of mast head standers  is an assertion based upon the generalbelief among archæologists  that the first pyramids were founded forastronomical purposes  a theory singularly supported by the peculiarstair like formation of all four sides of those edifices  whereby  withprodigious long upliftings of their legs  those old astronomers werewont to mount to the apex  and sing out for new stars  even as thelook outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail  or a whale just bearingin sight 
in saint stylites  the famous christian hermit of old times who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the wholelatter portion of his life on its summit  hoisting his food from theground with a tackle  in him we have a remarkable instance of adauntless stander of mast heads  who was not to be driven from hisplace by fogs or frosts  rain  hail  or sleet  but valiantly facingeverything out to the last  literally died at his post 
of modernstanders of mast heads we have but a lifeless set  mere stone  iron and bronze men  who  though well capable of facing out a stiff gale are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upondiscovering any strange sight 
there is napoleon  who  upon the top ofthe column of vendome  stands with arms folded  some one hundred andfifty feet in the air  careless  now  who rules the decks below whether louis philippe  louis blanc  or louis the devil 
greatwashington  too  stands high aloft on his towering main mast inbaltimore  and like one of hercules  pillars  his column marks thatpoint of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go 
admiralnelson  also  on a capstan of gun metal  stands his mast head intrafalgar square  and ever when most obscured by that london smoke token is yet given that a hidden hero is there  for where there issmoke  must be fire 
but neither great washington  nor napoleon  nornelson  will answer a single hail from below  however madly invoked tobefriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze however it may be surmised  that their spirits penetrate through thethick haze of the future  and descry what shoals and what rocks must beshunned it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast headstanders of the land with those of the sea  but that in truth it is notso  is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy  the solehistorian of nantucket  stands accountable 
the worthy obed tells us that in the early times of the whale fishery  ere ships were regularlylaunched in pursuit of the game  the people of that island erectedlofty spars along the sea coast  to which the look outs ascended bymeans of nailed cleats  something as fowls go upstairs in a hen house a few years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay whalemen of newzealand  who  upon descrying the game  gave notice to the ready mannedboats nigh the beach 
but this custom has now become obsolete  turn wethen to the one proper mast head  that of a whale ship at sea 
thethree mast heads are kept manned from sun rise to sun set  the seamentaking their regular turns  as at the helm   and relieving each otherevery two hours 
in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedinglypleasant the mast head  nay  to a dreamy meditative man it isdelightful 
there you stand  a hundred feet above the silent decks striding along the deep  as if the masts were gigantic stilts  whilebeneath you and between your legs  as it were  swim the hugest monstersof the sea  even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famouscolossus at old rhodes 
there you stand  lost in the infinite series ofthe sea  with nothing ruffled but the waves 
the tranced shipindolently rolls  the drowsy trade winds blow  everything resolves youinto languor 
for the most part  in this tropic whaling life  a sublimeuneventfulness invests you  you hear no news  read no gazettes  extraswith startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you intounnecessary excitements  you hear of no domestic afflictions  bankruptsecurities  fall of stocks  are never troubled with the thought of whatyou shall have for dinner for all your meals for three years and moreare snugly stowed in casks  and your bill of fare is immutable in one of those southern whalesmen  on a long three or four years voyage  as often happens  the sum of the various hours you spend at themast head would amount to several entire months 
and it is much to bedeplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portionof the whole term of your natural life  should be so sadly destitute ofanything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness  or adapted to breed acomfortable localness of feeling  such as pertains to a bed  a hammock a hearse  a sentry box  a pulpit  a coach  or any other of those smalland snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves 
yourmost usual point of perch is the head of the t  gallant mast  where youstand upon two thin parallel sticks  almost peculiar to whalemen called the t  gallant cross trees 
here  tossed about by the sea  thebeginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull s horns 
tobe sure  in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you  inthe shape of a watch coat  but properly speaking the thickestwatch coat is no more of a house than the unclad body  for as the soulis glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle  and cannot freely move aboutin it  nor even move out of it  without running great risk of perishing like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy alps in winter   so awatch coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope  oradditional skin encasing you 
you cannot put a shelf or chest ofdrawers in your body  and no more can you make a convenient closet ofyour watch coat concerning all this  it is much to be deplored that the mast heads of asouthern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents orpulpits  called crow s nests  in which the look outs of a greenlandwhaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas 
inthe fireside narrative of captain sleet  entitled  a voyage among theicebergs  in quest of the greenland whale  and incidentally for there discovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland   in thisadmirable volume  all standers of mast heads are furnished with acharmingly circumstantial account of the then recently inventedcrow s nest of the glacier  which was the name of captain sleet sgood craft 
he called it the sleet s crow s nest  in honor ofhimself  he being the original inventor and patentee  and free from allridiculous false delicacy  and holding that if we call our own childrenafter our own names  we fathers being the original inventors andpatentees   so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any otherapparatus we may beget 
in shape  the sleet s crow s nest is somethinglike a large tierce or pipe  it is open above  however  where it isfurnished with a movable side screen to keep to windward of your headin a hard gale 
being fixed on the summit of the mast  you ascend intoit through a little trap hatch in the bottom 
on the after side  orside next the stern of the ship  is a comfortable seat  with a lockerunderneath for umbrellas  comforters  and coats 
in front is a leatherrack  in which to keep your speaking trumpet  pipe  telescope  andother nautical conveniences 
when captain sleet in person stood hismast head in this crow s nest of his  he tells us that he always had arifle with him  also fixed in the rack   together with a powder flaskand shot  for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales  orvagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters  for you cannotsuccessfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of thewater  but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing 
now  itwas plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe  as he does all the little detailed conveniences of his crow s nest  but though heso enlarges upon many of these  and though he treats us to a veryscientific account of his experiments in this crow s nest  with a smallcompass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errorsresulting from what is called the  local attraction  of all binnaclemagnets  an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron inthe ship s planks  and in the glacier s case  perhaps  to there havingbeen so many broken down blacksmiths among her crew  i say  that thoughthe captain is very discreet and scientific here  yet  for all hislearned  binnacle deviations    azimuth compass observations   and approximate errors   he knows very well  captain sleet  that he wasnot so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations  as to failbeing attracted occasionally towards that well replenished littlecase bottle  so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow s nest  withineasy reach of his hand 
though  upon the whole  i greatly admire andeven love the brave  the honest  and learned captain  yet i take itvery ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case bottle seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been  whilewith mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematicsaloft there in that bird s nest within three or four perches of thepole but if we southern whale fishers are not so snugly housed aloft ascaptain sleet and his greenlandmen were  yet that disadvantage isgreatly counter balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of thoseseductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float 
for one  i usedto lounge up the rigging very leisurely  resting in the top to have achat with queequeg  or any one else off duty whom i might find there then ascending a little way further  and throwing a lazy leg over thetop sail yard  take a preliminary view of the watery pastures  and soat last mount to my ultimate destination let me make a clean breast of it here  and frankly admit that i keptbut sorry guard 
with the problem of the universe revolving in me  howcould i being left completely to myself at such a thought engenderingaltitude how could i but lightly hold my obligations to observe allwhale ships  standing orders   keep your weather eye open  and sing outevery time  and let me in this place movingly admonish you  ye ship owners ofnantucket 
beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad withlean brow and hollow eye  given to unseasonable meditativeness  and whooffers to ship with the phædon instead of bowditch in his head 
bewareof such an one  i say  your whales must be seen before they can bekilled  and this sunken eyed young platonist will tow you ten wakesround the world  and never make you one pint of sperm the richer 
norare these monitions at all unneeded 
for nowadays  the whale fisheryfurnishes an asylum for many romantic  melancholy  and absent mindedyoung men  disgusted with the carking cares of earth  and seekingsentiment in tar and blubber 
childe harold not unfrequently percheshimself upon the mast head of some luckless disappointed whale ship and in moody phrase ejaculates   roll on  thou deep and dark blue ocean  roll 
ten thousandblubber hunters sweep over thee in vain  very often do the captains of such ships take those absent minded youngphilosophers to task  upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient interest  in the voyage  half hinting that they are so hopelessly lostto all honorable ambition  as that in their secret souls they wouldrather not see whales than otherwise 
but all in vain  those youngplatonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect  they areshort sighted  what use  then  to strain the visual nerve 
they haveleft their opera glasses at home  why  thou monkey   said a harpooneer to one of these lads   we ve beencruising now hard upon three years  and thou hast not raised a whaleyet 
whales are scarce as hen s teeth whenever thou art up here  perhaps they were  or perhaps there might have been shoals of them inthe far horizon  but lulled into such an opium like listlessness ofvacant  unconscious reverie is this absent minded youth by the blendingcadence of waves with thoughts  that at last he loses his identity takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep blue  bottomless soul  pervading mankind and nature  and every strange half seen  gliding  beautiful thing that eludes him  everydimly discovered  uprising fin of some undiscernible form  seems to himthe embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul bycontinually flitting through it 
in this enchanted mood  thy spiritebbs away to whence it came  becomes diffused through time and space like cranmer s sprinkled pantheistic ashes  forming at last a part ofevery shore the round globe over there is no life in thee  now  except that rocking life imparted by agently rolling ship  by her  borrowed from the sea  by the sea  fromthe inscrutable tides of god 
but while this sleep  this dream is onye  move your foot or hand an inch  slip your hold at all  and youridentity comes back in horror 
over descartian vortices you hover 
andperhaps  at mid day  in the fairest weather  with one half throttledshriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea  nomore to rise for ever 
heed it well  ye pantheists chapter 36 
the quarter deck 
 enter ahab  then  all  it was not a great while after the affair of the pipe  that one morningshortly after breakfast  ahab  as was his wont  ascended thecabin gangway to the deck 
there most sea captains usually walk at thathour  as country gentlemen  after the same meal  take a few turns inthe garden soon his steady  ivory stride was heard  as to and fro he paced his oldrounds  upon planks so familiar to his tread  that they were all overdented  like geological stones  with the peculiar mark of his walk 
didyou fixedly gaze  too  upon that ribbed and dented brow  there also you would see still stranger foot prints the foot prints of his oneunsleeping  ever pacing thought but on the occasion in question  those dents looked deeper  even as hisnervous step that morning left a deeper mark 
and  so full of histhought was ahab  that at every uniform turn that he made  now at themain mast and now at the binnacle  you could almost see that thoughtturn in him as he turned  and pace in him as he paced  so completelypossessing him  indeed  that it all but seemed the inward mould ofevery outer movement  d ye mark him  flask   whispered stubb   the chick that s in him pecksthe shell 
 twill soon be out  the hours wore on  ahab now shut up within his cabin  anon  pacing thedeck  with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect it drew near the close of day 
suddenly he came to a halt by thebulwarks  and inserting his bone leg into the auger hole there  andwith one hand grasping a shroud  he ordered starbuck to send everybodyaft  sir   said the mate  astonished at an order seldom or never given onship board except in some extraordinary case  send everybody aft   repeated ahab 
 mast heads  there 
come down  when the entire ship s company were assembled  and with curious and notwholly unapprehensive faces  were eyeing him  for he looked not unlikethe weather horizon when a storm is coming up  ahab  after rapidlyglancing over the bulwarks  and then darting his eyes among the crew started from his standpoint  and as though not a soul were nigh himresumed his heavy turns upon the deck 
with bent head and half slouchedhat he continued to pace  unmindful of the wondering whispering amongthe men  till stubb cautiously whispered to flask  that ahab must havesummoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat but this did not last long 
vehemently pausing  he cried   what do ye do when ye see a whale  men   sing out for him   was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbedvoices  good   cried ahab  with a wild approval in his tones  observing thehearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magneticallythrown them  and what do ye next  men   lower away  and after him   and what tune is it ye pull to  men   a dead whale or a stove boat  more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving  grew thecountenance of the old man at every shout  while the mariners began togaze curiously at each other  as if marvelling how it was that theythemselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions but  they were all eagerness again  as ahab  now half revolving in hispivot hole  with one hand reaching high up a shroud  and tightly almost convulsively grasping it  addressed them thus   all ye mast headers have before now heard me give orders about a whitewhale 
look ye 
d ye see this spanish ounce of gold   holding up abroad bright coin to the sun  it is a sixteen dollar piece  men 
d yesee it 
mr  starbuck  hand me yon top maul  while the mate was getting the hammer  ahab  without speaking  wasslowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket  as ifto heighten its lustre  and without using any words was meanwhile lowlyhumming to himself  producing a sound so strangely muffled andinarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of hisvitality in him receiving the top maul from starbuck  he advanced towards the main mastwith the hammer uplifted in one hand  exhibiting the gold with theother  and with a high raised voice exclaiming   whosoever of ye raisesme a white headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw whosoever of ye raises me that white headed whale  with three holespunctured in his starboard fluke look ye  whosoever of ye raises methat same white whale  he shall have this gold ounce  my boys   huzza 
huzza   cried the seamen  as with swinging tarpaulins theyhailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast  it s a white whale  i say   resumed ahab  as he threw down thetopmaul   a white whale 
skin your eyes for him  men  look sharp forwhite water  if ye see but a bubble  sing out  all this while tashtego  daggoo  and queequeg had looked on with evenmore intense interest and surprise than the rest  and at the mention ofthe wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each wasseparately touched by some specific recollection  captain ahab   said tashtego   that white whale must be the same thatsome call moby dick   moby dick   shouted ahab 
 do ye know the white whale then  tash   does he fan tail a little curious  sir  before he goes down   said thegay header deliberately  and has he a curious spout  too   said daggoo   very bushy  even for aparmacetty  and mighty quick  captain ahab   and he have one  two  three oh 
good many iron in him hide  too captain   cried queequeg disjointedly   all twiske tee be twisk  likehim him   faltering hard for a word  and screwing his hand round andround as though uncorking a bottle  like him him   corkscrew   cried ahab   aye  queequeg  the harpoons lie all twistedand wrenched in him  aye  daggoo  his spout is a big one  like a wholeshock of wheat  and white as a pile of our nantucket wool after thegreat annual sheep shearing  aye  tashtego  and he fan tails like asplit jib in a squall 
death and devils 
men  it is moby dick ye haveseen moby dick moby dick   captain ahab   said starbuck  who  with stubb and flask  had thus farbeen eyeing his superior with increasing surprise  but at last seemedstruck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder 
 captainahab  i have heard of moby dick but it was not moby dick that took offthy leg   who told thee that   cried ahab  then pausing   aye  starbuck  aye  myhearties all round  it was moby dick that dismasted me  moby dick thatbrought me to this dead stump i stand on now 
aye  aye   he shoutedwith a terrific  loud  animal sob  like that of a heart stricken moose  aye  aye 
it was that accursed white whale that razed me  made a poorpegging lubber of me for ever and a day   then tossing both arms  withmeasureless imprecations he shouted out   aye  aye 
and i ll chase himround good hope  and round the horn  and round the norway maelstrom and round perdition s flames before i give him up 
and this is what yehave shipped for  men 
to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides of earth  till he spouts black blood and rolls finout 
what say ye  men  will ye splice hands on it  now 
i think ye dolook brave   aye  aye   shouted the harpooneers and seamen  running closer to theexcited old man   a sharp eye for the white whale  a sharp lance formoby dick   god bless ye   he seemed to half sob and half shout 
 god bless ye men 
go draw the great measure of grog 
but what s this longface about  mr  starbuck  wilt thou not chase the white whale 
art notgame for moby dick   i am game for his crooked jaw  and for the jaws of death too  captainahab  if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow  but icame here to hunt whales  not my commander s vengeance 
how manybarrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it  captainahab 
it will not fetch thee much in our nantucket market   nantucket market 
but come closer  starbuck  thou requirest alittle lower layer 
if money s to be the measurer  man  and theaccountants have computed their great counting house the globe  bygirdling it with guineas  one to every three parts of an inch  then let me tell thee  that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here   he smites his chest   whispered stubb   what s that for 
methinks itrings most vast  but hollow   vengeance on a dumb brute   cried starbuck   that simply smote theefrom blindest instinct 
to be enraged with a dumb thing captain ahab  seems blasphemous   hark ye yet again the little lower layer 
all visible objects  man are but as pasteboard masks 
but in each event in the living act  theundoubted deed there  some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forththe mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask 
if manwill strike  strike through the mask 
how can the prisoner reachoutside except by thrusting through the wall 
to me  the white whale isthat wall  shoved near to me 
sometimes i think there s naught beyond but  tis enough 
he tasks me  he heaps me  i see in him outrageousstrength  with an inscrutable malice sinewing it 
that inscrutablething is chiefly what i hate  and be the white whale agent  or be thewhite whale principal  i will wreak that hate upon him 
talk not to meof blasphemy  man  i d strike the sun if it insulted me

starbuck now is mine  cannot oppose me now  withoutrebellion   god keep me  keep us all   murmured starbuck  lowly but in his joy at the enchanted  tacit acquiescence of the mate  ahabdid not hear his foreboding invocation  nor yet the low laugh from thehold  nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage  noryet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts  as for a momenttheir hearts sank in

then ranging them before himnear the capstan  with their harpoons in their hands  while his threemates stood at his side with their lances  and the rest of the ship scompany formed a circle round the group  he stood for an instantsearchingly eyeing every man of his crew 
but those wild eyes met his as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of theirleader  ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison  but alas 
only to fall into the hidden snare of the indian  drink and pass   he cried  handing the heavy charged flagon to thenearest seaman

it seemed as though  by somenameless  interior volition  he would fain have shocked into them thesame fiery emotion accumulated within the leyden jar of his ownmagnetic life 
the three mates quailed before his strong  sustained and mystic aspect

starbuck paled and turned  and shivered 
once more  and finally  the replenishedpewter went the rounds among the frantic crew  when  waving his freehand to them  they all dispersed  and ahab retired within his cabin chapter 37

moby dick i  ishmael  was one of that crew  my shouts had gone up with the rest my oath had been welded with theirs  and stronger i shouted  and moredid i hammer and clinch my oath  because of the dread in my soul 
awild  mystical  sympathetical feeling was in me  ahab s quenchless feudseemed mine 
with greedy ears i learned the history of that murderousmonster against whom i and all the others had taken our oaths ofviolence and revenge for some time past  though at intervals only  the unaccompanied secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostlyfrequented by the sperm whale fishermen 
but not all of them knew ofhis existence  only a few of them  comparatively  had knowingly seenhim  while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly givenbattle to him  was small indeed 
for  owing to the large number ofwhale cruisers  the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entirewatery circumference  many of them adventurously pushing their questalong solitary latitudes  so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonthor more on a stretch  to encounter a single news telling sail of anysort  the inordinate length of each separate voyage  the irregularityof the times of sailing from home  all these  with other circumstances direct and indirect  long obstructed the spread through the wholeworld wide whaling fleet of the special individualizing tidingsconcerning moby dick 
it was hardly to be doubted  that several vesselsreported to have encountered  at such or such a time  or on such orsuch a meridian  a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity which whale  after doing great mischief to his assailants  hadcompletely escaped them  to some minds it was not an unfairpresumption  i say  that the whale in question must have been no otherthan moby dick 
yet as of late the sperm whale fishery had been markedby various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity  cunning  andmalice in the monster attacked  therefore it was  that those who byaccident ignorantly gave battle to moby dick  such hunters  perhaps for the most part  were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred more  as it were  to the perils of the sperm whale fishery at large than to the individual cause 
in that way  mostly  the disastrousencounter between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularlyregarded and as for those who  previously hearing of the white whale  by chancecaught sight of him  in the beginning of the thing they had every oneof them  almost  as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him  as for anyother whale of that species 
but at length  such calamities did ensuein these assaults not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles  brokenlimbs  or devouring amputations but fatal to the last degree offatality  those repeated disastrous repulses  all accumulating andpiling their terrors upon moby dick  those things had gone far to shakethe fortitude of many brave hunters  to whom the story of the whitewhale had eventually come nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate  and still the morehorrify the true histories of these deadly encounters 
for not only dofabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprisingterrible events  as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi  but  inmaritime life  far more than in that of terra firma  wild rumorsabound  wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to and as the sea surpasses the land in this matter  so the whale fisherysurpasses every other sort of maritime life  in the wonderfulness andfearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there 
for not onlyare whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance andsuperstitiousness hereditary to all sailors  but of all sailors  theyare by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever isappallingly astonishing in the sea  face to face they not only eye itsgreatest marvels  but  hand to jaw  give battle to them 
alone  in suchremotest waters  that though you sailed a thousand miles  and passed athousand shores  you would not come to any chiseled hearth stone  oraught hospitable beneath that part of the sun  in such latitudes andlongitudes  pursuing too such a calling as he does  the whaleman iswrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with manya mighty birth no wonder  then  that ever gathering volume from the mere transit overthe widest watery spaces  the outblown rumors of the white whale did inthe end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints  andhalf formed fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies  whicheventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from anythingthat visibly appears 
so that in many cases such a panic did he finallystrike  that few who by those rumors  at least  had heard of the whitewhale  few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of hisjaw but there were still other and more vital practical influences at work not even at the present day has the original prestige of the spermwhale  as fearfully distinguished from all other species of theleviathan  died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body 
there arethose this day among them  who  though intelligent and courageousenough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale  wouldperhaps either from professional inexperience  or incompetency  ortimidity  decline a contest with the sperm whale  at any rate  thereare plenty of whalemen  especially among those whaling nations notsailing under the american flag  who have never hostilely encounteredthe sperm whale  but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan isrestricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north seated on their hatches  these men will hearken with a childishfireside interest and awe  to the wild  strange tales of southernwhaling 
nor is the pre eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whaleanywhere more feelingly comprehended  than on board of those prowswhich stem him and as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendarytimes thrown its shadow before it  we find some booknaturalists olassen and povelson declaring the sperm whale not only tobe a consternation to every other creature in the sea  but also to beso incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood nor even down to so late a time as cuvier s  were these or almostsimilar impressions effaced 
for in his natural history  the baronhimself affirms that at sight of the sperm whale  all fish  sharksincluded  are  struck with the most lively terrors   and  often in theprecipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks withsuch violence as to cause instantaneous death   and however the generalexperiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these  yet intheir full terribleness  even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson  thesuperstitious belief in them is  in some vicissitudes of theirvocation  revived in the minds of the hunters so that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him  not a fewof the fishermen recalled  in reference to moby dick  the earlier daysof the sperm whale fishery  when it was oftentimes hard to induce longpractised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daringwarfare  such men protesting that although other leviathans might behopefully pursued  yet to chase and point lance at such an apparitionas the sperm whale was not for mortal man 
that to attempt it  would beinevitably to be torn into a quick eternity 
on this head  there aresome remarkable documents that may be consulted nevertheless  some there were  who even in the face of these thingswere ready to give chase to moby dick  and a still greater number who chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely  without thespecific details of any certain calamity  and without superstitiousaccompaniments  were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle ifoffered one of the wild suggestions referred to  as at last coming to be linkedwith the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined  wasthe unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous  that he hadactually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the sameinstant of time nor  credulous as such minds must have been  was this conceitaltogether without some faint show of superstitious probability 
for asthe secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged even to the most erudite research  so the hidden ways of the spermwhale when beneath the surface remain  in great part  unaccountable tohis pursuers  and from time to time have originated the most curiousand contradictory speculations regarding them  especially concerningthe mystic modes whereby  after sounding to a great depth  hetransports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distantpoints it is a thing well known to both american and english whale ships  andas well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by scoresby that some whales have been captured far north in the pacific  in whosebodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenlandseas 
nor is it to be gainsaid  that in some of these instances it hasbeen declared that the interval of time between the two assaults couldnot have exceeded very many days 
hence  by inference  it has beenbelieved by some whalemen  that the nor  west passage  so long aproblem to man  was never a problem to the whale 
so that here  in thereal living experience of living men  the prodigies related in oldtimes of the inland strello mountain in portugal  near whose top therewas said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to thesurface   and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountainnear syracuse  whose waters were believed to have come from the holyland by an underground passage   these fabulous narrations are almostfully equalled by the realities of the whalemen forced into familiarity  then  with such prodigies as these  andknowing that after repeated  intrepid assaults  the white whale hadescaped alive  it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemenshould go still further in their superstitions  declaring moby dick notonly ubiquitous  but immortal  for immortality is but ubiquity intime   that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks  hewould still swim away unharmed  or if indeed he should ever be made tospout thick blood  such a sight would be but a ghastly deception  foragain in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away  his unsulliedjet would once more be seen but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings  there was enough inthe earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strikethe imagination with unwonted power 
for  it was not so much hisuncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales but  as was elsewhere thrown out a peculiar snow white wrinkledforehead  and a high  pyramidical white hump 
these were his prominentfeatures  the tokens whereby  even in the limitless  uncharted seas  herevealed his identity  at a long distance  to those who knew him the rest of his body was so streaked  and spotted  and marbled with thesame shrouded hue  that  in the end  he had gained his distinctiveappellation of the white whale  a name  indeed  literally justified byhis vivid aspect  when seen gliding at high noon through a dark bluesea  leaving a milky way wake of creamy foam  all spangled with goldengleamings nor was it his unwonted magnitude  nor his remarkable hue  nor yet hisdeformed lower jaw  that so much invested the whale with naturalterror  as that unexampled  intelligent malignity which  according tospecific accounts  he had over and over again evinced in his assaults more than all  his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay thanperhaps aught else 
for  when swimming before his exulting pursuers with every apparent symptom of alarm  he had several times been knownto turn round suddenly  and  bearing down upon them  either stave theirboats to splinters  or drive them back in consternation to their ship already several fatalities had attended his chase 
but though similardisasters  however little bruited ashore  were by no means unusual inthe fishery  yet  in most instances  such seemed the white whale sinfernal aforethought of ferocity  that every dismembering or deaththat he caused  was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by anunintelligent agent judge  then  to what pitches of inflamed  distracted fury the minds ofhis more desperate hunters were impelled  when amid the chips of chewedboats  and the sinking limbs of torn comrades  they swam out of thewhite curds of the whale s direful wrath into the serene  exasperatingsunlight  that smiled on  as if at a birth or a bridal his three boats stove around him  and oars and men both whirling in theeddies  one captain  seizing the line knife from his broken prow  haddashed at the whale  as an arkansas duellist at his foe  blindlyseeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom deep life of thewhale 
that captain was ahab 
and then it was  that suddenly sweepinghis sickle shaped lower jaw beneath him  moby dick had reaped awayahab s leg  as a mower a blade of grass in the field 
no turbaned turk no hired venetian or malay  could have smote him with more seemingmalice 
small reason was there to doubt  then  that ever since thatalmost fatal encounter  ahab had cherished a wild vindictivenessagainst the whale  all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidnesshe at last came to identify with him  not only all his bodily woes  butall his intellectual and spiritual exasperations 
the white whale swambefore him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those maliciousagencies which some deep men feel eating in them  till they are leftliving on with half a heart and half a lung 
that intangible malignitywhich has been from the beginning  to whose dominion even the modernchristians ascribe one half of the worlds  which the ancient ophites ofthe east reverenced in their statue devil  ahab did not fall down andworship it like them  but deliriously transferring its idea to theabhorred white whale  he pitted himself  all mutilated  against it 
allthat most maddens and torments  all that stirs up the lees of things all truth with malice in it  all that cracks the sinews and cakes thebrain  all the subtle demonisms of life and thought  all evil  to crazyahab  were visibly personified  and made practically assailable in mobydick 
he piled upon the whale s white hump the sum of all the generalrage and hate felt by his whole race from adam down  and then  as ifhis chest had been a mortar  he burst his hot heart s shell upon it it is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise atthe precise time of his bodily dismemberment 
then  in darting at themonster  knife in hand  he had but given loose to a sudden  passionate corporal animosity  and when he received the stroke that tore him  heprobably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration  but nothing more yet  when by this collision forced to turn towards home  and for longmonths of days and weeks  ahab and anguish lay stretched together inone hammock  rounding in mid winter that dreary  howling patagoniancape  then it was  that his torn body and gashed soul bled into oneanother  and so interfusing  made him mad 
that it was only then  onthe homeward voyage  after the encounter  that the final monomaniaseized him  seems all but certain from the fact that  at intervalsduring the passage  he was a raving lunatic  and  though unlimbed of aleg  yet such vital strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest  and wasmoreover intensified by his delirium  that his mates were forced tolace him fast  even there  as he sailed  raving in his hammock 
in astrait jacket  he swung to the mad rockings of the gales 
and  whenrunning into more sufferable latitudes  the ship  with mild stun sailsspread  floated across the tranquil tropics  and  to all appearances the old man s delirium seemed left behind him with the cape hornswells  and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light andair  even then  when he bore that firm  collected front  however pale and issued his calm orders once again  and his mates thanked god thedireful madness was now gone  even then  ahab  in his hidden self raved on 
human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing when you think it fled  it may have but become transfigured into somestill subtler form 
ahab s full lunacy subsided not  but deepeninglycontracted  like the unabated hudson  when that noble northman flowsnarrowly  but unfathomably through the highland gorge 
but  as in hisnarrow flowing monomania  not one jot of ahab s broad madness had beenleft behind  so in that broad madness  not one jot of his great naturalintellect had perished 
that before living agent  now became the livinginstrument 
if such a furious trope may stand  his special lunacystormed his general sanity  and carried it  and turned all itsconcentred cannon upon its own mad mark  so that far from having losthis strength  ahab  to that one end  did now possess a thousand foldmore potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any onereasonable object this is much  yet ahab s larger  darker  deeper part remains unhinted but vain to popularize profundities  and all truth is profound 
windingfar down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny wherewe here stand however grand and wonderful  now quit it  and take yourway  ye nobler  sadder souls  to those vast roman halls of thermes where far beneath the fantastic towers of man s upper earth  his rootof grandeur  his whole awful essence sits in bearded state  an antiqueburied beneath antiquities  and throned on torsoes 
so with a brokenthrone  the great gods mock that captive king  so like a caryatid  hepatient sits  upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures ofages 
wind ye down there  ye prouder  sadder souls 
question thatproud  sad king 
a family likeness 
aye  he did beget ye  ye youngexiled royalties  and from your grim sire only will the oldstate secret come now  in his heart  ahab had some glimpse of this  namely  all my meansare sane  my motive and my object mad 
yet without power to kill  orchange  or shun the fact  he likewise knew that to mankind he did longdissemble  in some sort  did still 
but that thing of his dissemblingwas only subject to his perceptibility  not to his will determinate nevertheless  so well did he succeed in that dissembling  that whenwith ivory leg he stepped ashore at last  no nantucketer thought himotherwise than but naturally grieved  and that to the quick  with theterrible casualty which had overtaken him the report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularlyascribed to a kindred cause 
and so too  all the added moodiness whichalways afterwards  to the very day of sailing in the pequod on thepresent voyage  sat brooding on his brow 
nor is it so very unlikely that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage  onaccount of such dark symptoms  the calculating people of that prudentisle were inclined to harbor the conceit  that for those very reasonshe was all the better qualified and set on edge  for a pursuit so fullof rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales 
gnawed within andscorched without  with the infixed  unrelenting fangs of some incurableidea  such an one  could he be found  would seem the very man to darthis iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes or  if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl onhis underlings to the attack 
but be all this as it may  certain it is that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed inhim  ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the oneonly and all engrossing object of hunting the white whale 
had any oneof his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurkingin him then  how soon would their aghast and righteous souls havewrenched the ship from such a fiendish man 
they were bent onprofitable cruises  the profit to be counted down in dollars from themint 
he was intent on an audacious  immitigable  and supernaturalrevenge here  then  was this grey headed  ungodly old man  chasing with cursesa job s whale round the world  at the head of a crew  too  chiefly madeup of mongrel renegades  and castaways  and cannibals morally enfeebledalso  by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right mindedness instarbuck  the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness instubb  and the pervading mediocrity in flask 
such a crew  soofficered  seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatalityto help him to his monomaniac revenge 
how it was that they soaboundingly responded to the old man s ire by what evil magic theirsouls were possessed  that at times his hate seemed almost theirs  thewhite whale as much their insufferable foe as his  how all this came tobe what the white whale was to them  or how to their unconsciousunderstandings  also  in some dim  unsuspected way  he might haveseemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life  all this toexplain  would be to dive deeper than ishmael can go 
the subterraneanminer that works in us all  how can one tell whither leads his shaft bythe ever shifting  muffled sound of his pick 
who does not feel theirresistible arm drag 
what skiff in tow of a seventy four can standstill 
for one  i gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and theplace  but while yet all a rush to encounter the whale  could seenaught in that brute but the deadliest ill chapter 42 
the whiteness of the whale what the white whale was to ahab  has been hinted  what  at times  hewas to me  as yet remains unsaid aside from those more obvious considerations touching moby dick  whichcould not but occasionally awaken in any man s soul some alarm  therewas another thought  or rather vague  nameless horror concerning him which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it  that i almostdespair of putting it in a comprehensible form 
it was the whiteness ofthe whale that above all things appalled me 
but how can i hope toexplain myself here  and yet  in some dim  random way  explain myself imust  else all these chapters might be naught though in many natural objects  whiteness refiningly enhances beauty as if imparting some special virtue of its own  as in marbles japonicas  and pearls  and though various nations have in some wayrecognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue  even the barbaric grand old kings of pegu placing the title  lord of the white elephants above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion  and themodern kings of siam unfurling the same snow white quadruped in theroyal standard  and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of asnow white charger  and the great austrian empire  cæsarian  heir tooverlording rome  having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue and though this pre eminence in it applies to the human race itself giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe  andthough  besides  all this  whiteness has been even made significant ofgladness  for among the romans a white stone marked a joyful day  andthough in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings  this same hue ismade the emblem of many touching  noble things the innocence of brides the benignity of age  though among the red men of america the giving ofthe white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor  though inmany climes  whiteness typifies the majesty of justice in the ermine ofthe judge  and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawnby milk white steeds  though even in the higher mysteries of the mostaugust religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessnessand power  by the persian fire worshippers  the white forked flamebeing held the holiest on the altar  and in the greek mythologies great jove himself being made incarnate in a snow white bull  andthough to the noble iroquois  the midwinter sacrifice of the sacredwhite dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology  thatspotless  faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could sendto the great spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity  andthough directly from the latin word for white  all christian priestsderive the name of one part of their sacred vesture  the alb or tunic worn beneath the cassock  and though among the holy pomps of the romishfaith  white is specially employed in the celebration of the passion ofour lord  though in the vision of st  john  white robes are given tothe redeemed  and the four and twenty elders stand clothed in whitebefore the great white throne  and the holy one that sitteth therewhite like wool  yet for all these accumulated associations  withwhatever is sweet  and honorable  and sublime  there yet lurks anelusive something in the innermost idea of this hue  which strikes moreof panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood this elusive quality it is  which causes the thought of whiteness  whendivorced from more kindly associations  and coupled with any objectterrible in itself  to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds witness the white bear of the poles  and the white shark of thetropics  what but their smooth  flaky whiteness makes them thetranscendent horrors they are 
that ghastly whiteness it is whichimparts such an abhorrent mildness  even more loathsome than terrific to the dumb gloating of their aspect 
so that not the fierce fangedtiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white shroudedbear or shark 
  with reference to the polar bear  it may possibly be urged by him whowould fain go still deeper into this matter  that it is not thewhiteness  separately regarded  which heightens the intolerablehideousness of that brute  for  analysed  that heightened hideousness it might be said  only rises from the circumstance  that theirresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in thefleece of celestial innocence and love  and hence  by bringing togethertwo such opposite emotions in our minds  the polar bear frightens uswith so unnatural a contrast 
but even assuming all this to be true yet  were it not for the whiteness  you would not have that intensifiedterror as for the white shark  the white gliding ghostliness of repose in thatcreature  when beheld in his ordinary moods  strangely tallies with thesame quality in the polar quadruped 
this peculiarity is most vividlyhit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish 
the romishmass for the dead begins with  requiem eternam   eternal rest   whencerequiem denominating the mass itself  and any other funeral music now  in allusion to the white  silent stillness of death in this shark and the mild deadliness of his habits  the french call him requin bethink thee of the albatross  whence come those clouds of spiritualwonderment and pale dread  in which that white phantom sails in allimaginations 
not coleridge first threw that spell  but god s great unflattering laureate  nature 
  i remember the first albatross i ever saw 
it was during a prolongedgale  in waters hard upon the antarctic seas 
from my forenoon watchbelow  i ascended to the overclouded deck  and there  dashed upon themain hatches  i saw a regal  feathery thing of unspotted whiteness  andwith a hooked  roman bill sublime 
at intervals  it arched forth itsvast archangel wings  as if to embrace some holy ark 
wondrousflutterings and throbbings shook it 
though bodily unharmed  it utteredcries  as some king s ghost in supernatural distress 
through itsinexpressible  strange eyes  methought i peeped to secrets which tookhold of god 
as abraham before the angels  i bowed myself  the whitething was so white  its wings so wide  and in those for ever exiledwaters  i had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and oftowns 
long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage 
i cannot tell  can onlyhint  the things that darted through me then 
but at last i awoke  andturning  asked a sailor what bird was this 
a goney  he replied 
goney never had heard that name before  is it conceivable that this gloriousthing is utterly unknown to men ashore 
but some time after  ilearned that goney was some seaman s name for albatross 
so that by nopossibility could coleridge s wild rhyme have had aught to do withthose mystical impressions which were mine  when i saw that bird uponour deck 
for neither had i then read the rhyme  nor knew the bird tobe an albatross 
yet  in saying this  i do but indirectly burnish alittle brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet i assert  then  that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the birdchiefly lurks the secret of the spell  a truth the more evinced inthis  that by a solecism of terms there are birds called greyalbatrosses  and these i have frequently seen  but never with suchemotions as when i beheld the antarctic fowl but how had the mystic thing been caught 
whisper it not  and i willtell  with a treacherous hook and line  as the fowl floated on the sea at last the captain made a postman of it  tying a lettered  leatherntally round its neck  with the ship s time and place  and then lettingit escape 
but i doubt not  that leathern tally  meant for man  wastaken off in heaven  when the white fowl flew to join the wing folding the invoking  and adoring cherubim most famous in our western annals and indian traditions is that of thewhite steed of the prairies  a magnificent milk white charger large eyed  small headed  bluff chested  and with the dignity of athousand monarchs in his lofty  overscorning carriage 
he was theelected xerxes of vast herds of wild horses  whose pastures in thosedays were only fenced by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies 
attheir flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star whichevery evening leads on the hosts of light 
the flashing cascade of hismane  the curving comet of his tail  invested him with housings moreresplendent than gold and silver beaters could have furnished him 
amost imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen  westernworld  which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived theglories of those primeval times when adam walked majestic as a god bluff browed and fearless as this mighty steed 
whether marching amidhis aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlesslystreamed it over the plains  like an ohio  or whether with hiscircumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon  the whitesteed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening throughhis cool milkiness  in whatever aspect he presented himself  always tothe bravest indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of thisnoble horse  that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly  which soclothed him with divineness  and that this divineness had that in itwhich  though commanding worship  at the same time enforced a certainnameless terror but there are other instances where this whiteness loses all thataccessory and strange glory which invests it in the white steed andalbatross what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocksthe eye  as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin 
it isthat whiteness which invests him  a thing expressed by the name hebears 
the albino is as well made as other men has no substantivedeformity and yet this mere aspect of all pervading whiteness makes himmore strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion 
why should this beso nor  in quite other aspects  does nature in her least palpable but notthe less malicious agencies  fail to enlist among her forces thiscrowning attribute of the terrible 
from its snowy aspect  thegauntleted ghost of the southern seas has been denominated the whitesquall 
nor  in some historic instances  has the art of human maliceomitted so potent an auxiliary 
how wildly it heightens the effect ofthat passage in froissart  when  masked in the snowy symbol of theirfaction  the desperate white hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in themarket place nor  in some things  does the common  hereditary experience of allmankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue 
itcannot well be doubted  that the one visible quality in the aspect ofthe dead which most appals the gazer  is the marble pallor lingeringthere  as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge ofconsternation in the other world  as of mortal trepidation here 
andfrom that pallor of the dead  we borrow the expressive hue of theshroud in which we wrap them 
nor even in our superstitions do we failto throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms  all ghosts rising ina milk white fog yea  while these terrors seize us  let us add  thateven the king of terrors  when personified by the evangelist  rides onhis pallid horse therefore  in his other moods  symbolize whatever grand or graciousthing he will by whiteness  no man can deny that in its profoundestidealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul but though without dissent this point be fixed  how is mortal man toaccount for it 
to analyse it  would seem impossible 
can we  then  bythe citation of some of those instances wherein this thing ofwhiteness though for the time either wholly or in great part strippedof all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful but nevertheless  is found to exert over us the same sorcery  howevermodified  can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct usto the hidden cause we seek let us try 
but in a matter like this  subtlety appeals to subtlety and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls 
andthough  doubtless  some at least of the imaginative impressions aboutto be presented may have been shared by most men  yet few perhaps wereentirely conscious of them at the time  and therefore may not be ableto recall them now why to the man of untutored ideality  who happens to be but looselyacquainted with the peculiar character of the day  does the baremention of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long  dreary speechless processions of slow pacing pilgrims  down cast and hoodedwith new fallen snow 
or  to the unread  unsophisticated protestant ofthe middle american states  why does the passing mention of a whitefriar or a white nun  evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors andkings  which will not wholly account for it  that makes the white towerof london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of anuntravelled american  than those other storied structures  itsneighbors the byward tower  or even the bloody 
and those sublimertowers  the white mountains of new hampshire  whence  in peculiarmoods  comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the baremention of that name  while the thought of virginia s blue ridge isfull of a soft  dewy  distant dreaminess 
or why  irrespective of alllatitudes and longitudes  does the name of the white sea exert such aspectralness over the fancy  while that of the yellow sea lulls us withmortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets 
or  to choose awholly unsubstantial instance  purely addressed to the fancy  why  inreading the old fairy tales of central europe  does  the tall pale man of the hartz forests  whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glidesthrough the green of the groves why is this phantom more terrible thanall the whooping imps of the blocksburg nor is it  altogether  the remembrance of her cathedral topplingearthquakes  nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas  nor thetearlessness of arid skies that never rain  nor the sight of her widefield of leaning spires  wrenched cope stones  and crosses all adroop like canted yards of anchored fleets   and her suburban avenues ofhouse walls lying over upon each other  as a tossed pack of cards  itis not these things alone which make tearless lima  the strangest saddest city thou can st see 
for lima has taken the white veil  andthere is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe 
old as pizarro this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new  admits not the cheerfulgreenness of complete decay  spreads over her broken ramparts the rigidpallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions i know that  to the common apprehension  this phenomenon of whitenessis not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror ofobjects otherwise terrible  nor to the unimaginative mind is thereaught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mindalmost solely consists in this one phenomenon  especially whenexhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness oruniversality 
what i mean by these two statements may perhaps berespectively elucidated by the following examples first  the mariner  when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands  ifby night he hear the roar of breakers  starts to vigilance  and feelsjust enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties  but underprecisely similar circumstances  let him be called from his hammock toview his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness as iffrom encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimminground him  then he feels a silent  superstitious dread  the shroudedphantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost  invain the lead assures him he is still off soundings  heart and helmthey both go down  he never rests till blue water is under him again yet where is the mariner who will tell thee   sir  it was not so muchthe fear of striking hidden rocks  as the fear of that hideouswhiteness that so stirred me  second  to the native indian of peru  the continual sight of thesnow howdahed andes conveys naught of dread  except  perhaps  in themere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vastaltitudes  and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be tolose oneself in such inhuman solitudes 
much the same is it with thebackwoodsman of the west  who with comparative indifference views anunbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow  no shadow of tree or twigto break the fixed trance of whiteness 
not so the sailor  beholdingthe scenery of the antarctic seas  where at times  by some infernaltrick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air  he  shivering andhalf shipwrecked  instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to hismisery  views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him withits lean ice monuments and splintered crosses but thou sayest  methinks that white lead chapter about whiteness isbut a white flag hung out from a craven soul  thou surrenderest to ahypo  ishmael tell me  why this strong young colt  foaled in some peaceful valley ofvermont  far removed from all beasts of prey why is it that upon thesunniest day  if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him  so thathe cannot even see it  but only smells its wild animal muskiness whywill he start  snort  and with bursting eyes paw the ground inphrensies of affright 
there is no remembrance in him of any gorings ofwild creatures in his green northern home  so that the strangemuskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with theexperience of former perils  for what knows he  this new england colt of the black bisons of distant oregon no  but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute  the instinct of theknowledge of the demonism in the world 
though thousands of miles fromoregon  still when he smells that savage musk  the rending  goringbison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of theprairies  which this instant they may be trampling into dust thus  then  the muffled rollings of a milky sea  the bleak rustlings ofthe festooned frosts of mountains  the desolate shiftings of thewindrowed snows of prairies  all these  to ishmael  are as the shakingof that buffalo robe to the frightened colt though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mysticsign gives forth such hints  yet with me  as with the colt  somewherethose things must exist 
though in many of its aspects this visibleworld seems formed in love  the invisible spheres were formed infright but not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness  andlearned why it appeals with such power to the soul  and more strangeand far more portentous why  as we have seen  it is at once the mostmeaning symbol of spiritual things  nay  the very veil of thechristian s deity  and yet should be as it is  the intensifying agentin things the most appalling to mankind is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voidsand immensities of the universe  and thus stabs us from behind with thethought of annihilation  when beholding the white depths of the milkyway 
or is it  that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour asthe visible absence of colour  and at the same time the concrete of allcolours  is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness full of meaning  in a wide landscape of snows a colourless  all colourof atheism from which we shrink 
and when we consider that other theoryof the natural philosophers  that all other earthly hues every statelyor lovely emblazoning the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods  yea and the gilded velvets of butterflies  and the butterfly cheeks ofyoung girls  all these are but subtile deceits  not actually inherentin substances  but only laid on from without  so that all deifiednature absolutely paints like the harlot  whose allurements covernothing but the charnel house within  and when we proceed further  andconsider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of herhues  the great principle of light  for ever remains white or colorlessin itself  and if operating without medium upon matter  would touch allobjects  even tulips and roses  with its own blank tinge pondering allthis  the palsied universe lies before us a leper  and like wilfultravellers in lapland  who refuse to wear coloured and colouringglasses upon their eyes  so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind atthe monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him 
andof all these things the albino whale was the symbol 
wonder ye then atthe fiery hunt chapter 43 
did you hear that noise  cabaco  it was the middle watch  a fair moonlight  the seamen were standing ina cordon  extending from one of the fresh water butts in the waist  tothe scuttle butt near the taffrail 
in this manner  they passed thebuckets to fill the scuttle butt 
standing  for the most part  on thehallowed precincts of the quarter deck  they were careful not to speakor rustle their feet 
from hand to hand  the buckets went in thedeepest silence  only broken by the occasional flap of a sail  and thesteady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel it was in the midst of this repose  that archy  one of the cordon whose post was near the after hatches  whispered to his neighbor  acholo  the words above  hist 
did you hear that noise  cabaco   take the bucket  will ye  archy 
what noise d ye mean   there it is again under the hatches don t you hear it a cough itsounded like a cough   cough be damned 
pass along that return bucket   there again there it is  it sounds like two or three sleepers turningover  now   caramba 
have done  shipmate  will ye 
it s the three soaked biscuitsye eat for supper turning over inside of ye nothing else 
look to thebucket   say what ye will  shipmate  i ve sharp ears   aye  you are the chap  ain t ye  that heard the hum of the oldquakeress s knitting needles fifty miles at sea from nantucket  you rethe chap   grin away  we ll see what turns up 
hark ye  cabaco  there is somebodydown in the after hold that has not yet been seen on deck  and isuspect our old mogul knows something of it too 
i heard stubb tellflask  one morning watch  that there was something of that sort in thewind   tish 
the bucket  chapter 44 
the chart had you followed captain ahab down into his cabin after the squall thattook place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of hispurpose with his crew  you would have seen him go to a locker in thetransom  and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish seacharts  spread them before him on his screwed down table 
then seatinghimself before it  you would have seen him intently study the variouslines and shadings which there met his eye  and with slow but steadypencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank 
atintervals  he would refer to piles of old log books beside him  whereinwere set down the seasons and places in which  on various formervoyages of various ships  sperm whales had been captured or seen while thus employed  the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over hishead  continually rocked with the motion of the ship  and for everthrew shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow  tillit almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines andcourses on the wrinkled charts  some invisible pencil was also tracinglines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead but it was not this night in particular that  in the solitude of hiscabin  ahab thus pondered over his charts 
almost every night they werebrought out  almost every night some pencil marks were effaced  andothers were substituted 
for with the charts of all four oceans beforehim  ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies  with a view tothe more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul now  to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitarycreature in the unhooped oceans of this planet 
but not so did it seemto ahab  who knew the sets of all tides and currents  and therebycalculating the driftings of the sperm whale s food  and  also  callingto mind the regular  ascertained seasons for hunting him in particularlatitudes  could arrive at reasonable surmises  almost approaching tocertainties  concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or thatground in search of his prey so assured  indeed  is the fact concerning the periodicalness of thesperm whale s resorting to given waters  that many hunters believethat  could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefullycollated  then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found tocorrespond in invariability to those of the herring shoals or theflights of swallows 
on this hint  attempts have been made to constructelaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale 
    since the above was written  the statement is happily borne out by  an official circular  issued by lieutenant maury  of the national  observatory  washington  april 16th  1851 
by that circular  it  appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion  and  portions of it are presented in the circular 
 this chart divides the  ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of  longitude  perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve  columns for the twelve months  and horizontally through each of which  districts are three lines  one to show the number of days that have  been spent in each month in every district  and the two others to  show the number of days in which whales  sperm or right  have been  seen  besides  when making a passage from one feeding ground to another  thesperm whales  guided by some infallible instinct say  rather  secretintelligence from the deity mostly swim in veins  as they are called continuing their way along a given ocean line with such undeviatingexactitude  that no ship ever sailed her course  by any chart  with onetithe of such marvellous precision 
though  in these cases  thedirection taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor s parallel and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its ownunavoidable  straight wake  yet the arbitrary vein in which at thesetimes he is said to swim  generally embraces some few miles in width more or less  as the vein is presumed to expand or contract   butnever exceeds the visual sweep from the whale ship s mast heads  whencircumspectly gliding along this magic zone 
the sum is  that atparticular seasons within that breadth and along that path  migratingwhales may with great confidence be looked for and hence not only at substantiated times  upon well known separatefeeding grounds  could ahab hope to encounter his prey  but in crossingthe widest expanses of water between those grounds he could  by hisart  so place and time himself on his way  as even then not to bewholly without prospect of a meeting there was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle hisdelirious but still methodical scheme 
but not so in the reality perhaps 
though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasonsfor particular grounds  yet in general you cannot conclude that theherds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year say  will turn out to be identically the same with those that werefound there the preceding season  though there are peculiar andunquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true 
ingeneral  the same remark  only within a less wide limit  applies to thesolitaries and hermits among the matured  aged sperm whales 
so thatthough moby dick had in a former year been seen  for example  on whatis called the seychelle ground in the indian ocean  or volcano bay onthe japanese coast  yet it did not follow  that were the pequod tovisit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season  shewould infallibly encounter him there 
so  too  with some other feedinggrounds  where he had at times revealed himself 
but all these seemedonly his casual stopping places and ocean inns  so to speak  not hisplaces of prolonged abode 
and where ahab s chances of accomplishinghis object have hitherto been spoken of  allusion has only been made towhatever way side  antecedent  extra prospects were his  ere aparticular set time or place were attained  when all possibilitieswould become probabilities  and  as ahab fondly thought  everypossibility the next thing to a certainty 
that particular set time andplace were conjoined in the one technical phrase theseason on the line 
for there and then  for several consecutive years moby dick had been periodically descried  lingering in those waters forawhile  as the sun  in its annual round  loiters for a predictedinterval in any one sign of the zodiac 
there it was  too  that most ofthe deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place  there thewaves were storied with his deeds  there also was that tragic spotwhere the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to hisvengeance 
but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloiteringvigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfalteringhunt  he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the onecrowning fact above mentioned  however flattering it might be to thosehopes  nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize hisunquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest now  the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very beginning of theseason on the line 
no possible endeavor then could enable hercommander to make the great passage southwards  double cape horn  andthen running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorialpacific in time to cruise there 
therefore  he must wait for the nextensuing season 
yet the premature hour of the pequod s sailing had perhaps  been correctly selected by ahab  with a view to this verycomplexion of things 
because  an interval of three hundred andsixty five days and nights was before him  an interval which  insteadof impatiently enduring ashore  he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt if by chance the white whale  spending his vacation in seas far remotefrom his periodical feeding grounds  should turn up his wrinkled browoff the persian gulf  or in the bengal bay  or china seas  or in anyother waters haunted by his race 
so that monsoons  pampas nor  westers  harmattans  trades  any wind but the levanter and simoon might blow moby dick into the devious zig zag world circle of thepequod s circumnavigating wake but granting all this  yet  regarded discreetly and coolly  seems itnot but a mad idea  this  that in the broad boundless ocean  onesolitary whale  even if encountered  should be thought capable ofindividual recognition from his hunter  even as a white bearded muftiin the thronged thoroughfares of constantinople 
for the peculiarsnow white brow of moby dick  and his snow white hump  could not but beunmistakable 
and have i not tallied the whale  ahab would mutter tohimself  as after poring over his charts till long after midnight hewould throw himself back in reveries tallied him  and shall he escape his broad fins are bored  and scalloped out like a lost sheep s ear and here  his mad mind would run on in a breathless race  till aweariness and faintness of pondering came over him  and in the open airof the deck he would seek to recover his strength 
ah  god 
whattrances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with oneunachieved revengeful desire 
he sleeps with clenched hands  and wakeswith his own bloody nails in his palms often  when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vividdreams of the night  which  resuming his own intense thoughts throughthe day  carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies  and whirled themround and round and round in his blazing brain  till the very throbbingof his life spot became insufferable anguish  and when  as wassometimes the case  these spiritual throes in him heaved his being upfrom its base  and a chasm seemed opening in him  from which forkedflames and lightnings shot up  and accursed fiends beckoned him to leapdown among them  when this hell in himself yawned beneath him  a wildcry would be heard through the ship  and with glaring eyes ahab wouldburst from his state room  as though escaping from a bed that was onfire 
yet these  perhaps  instead of being the unsuppressable symptomsof some latent weakness  or fright at his own resolve  were but theplainest tokens of its intensity 
for  at such times  crazy ahab  thescheming  unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale  this ahabthat had gone to his hammock  was not the agent that so caused him toburst from it in horror again 
the latter was the eternal  livingprinciple or soul in him  and in sleep  being for the time dissociatedfrom the characterizing mind  which at other times employed it for itsouter vehicle or agent  it spontaneously sought escape from thescorching contiguity of the frantic thing  of which  for the time  itwas no longer an integral 
but as the mind does not exist unlessleagued with the soul  therefore it must have been that  in ahab scase  yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supremepurpose  that purpose  by its own sheer inveteracy of will  forceditself against gods and devils into a kind of self assumed  independentbeing of its own 
nay  could grimly live and burn  while the commonvitality to which it was conjoined  fled horror stricken from theunbidden and unfathered birth 
therefore  the tormented spirit thatglared out of bodily eyes  when what seemed ahab rushed from his room was for the time but a vacated thing  a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light  to be sure  but without an object to colour  andtherefore a blankness in itself 
god help thee  old man  thy thoughtshave created a creature in thee  and he whose intense thinking thusmakes him a prometheus  a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever  thatvulture the very creature he creates chapter 45 
the affidavit so far as what there may be of a narrative in this book  and  indeed as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curiousparticulars in the habits of sperm whales  the foregoing chapter  inits earlier part  is as important a one as will be found in thisvolume  but the leading matter of it requires to be still further andmore familiarly enlarged upon  in order to be adequately understood and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance ofthe entire subject may induce in some minds  as to the natural verityof the main points of this affair i care not to perform this part of my task methodically  but shall becontent to produce the desired impression by separate citations ofitems  practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman  and fromthese citations  i take it the conclusion aimed at will naturallyfollow of itself first  i have personally known three instances where a whale  afterreceiving a harpoon  has effected a complete escape  and  after aninterval  in one instance of three years   has been again struck by thesame hand  and slain  when the two irons  both marked by the sameprivate cypher  have been taken from the body 
in the instance wherethree years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons  and ithink it may have been something more than that  the man who dartedthem happening  in the interval  to go in a trading ship on a voyage toafrica  went ashore there  joined a discovery party  and penetrated farinto the interior  where he travelled for a period of nearly two years often endangered by serpents  savages  tigers  poisonous miasmas  withall the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart ofunknown regions 
meanwhile  the whale he had struck must also have beenon its travels  no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe brushing with its flanks all the coasts of africa  but to no purpose this man and this whale again came together  and the one vanquished theother 
i say i  myself  have known three instances similar to this that is in two of them i saw the whales struck  and  upon the secondattack  saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them afterwards taken from the dead fish 
in the three year instance  it sofell out that i was in the boat both times  first and last  and thelast time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under thewhale s eye  which i had observed there three years previous 
i saythree years  but i am pretty sure it was more than that 
here are threeinstances  then  which i personally know the truth of  but i have heardof many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter thereis no good ground to impeach secondly  it is well known in the sperm whale fishery  however ignorantthe world ashore may be of it  that there have been several memorablehistorical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been atdistant times and places popularly cognisable 
why such a whale becamethus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodilypeculiarities as distinguished from other whales  for however peculiarin that respect any chance whale may be  they soon put an end to hispeculiarities by killing him  and boiling him down into a peculiarlyvaluable oil 
no  the reason was this  that from the fatal experiencesof the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness aboutsuch a whale as there did about rinaldo rinaldini  insomuch that mostfishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching theirtarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance 
like somepoor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man  theymake distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street  lest if theypursued the acquaintance further  they might receive a summary thumpfor their presumption but not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individualcelebrity nay  you may call it an ocean wide renown  not only was hefamous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death but he was admitted into all the rights  privileges  and distinctionsof a name  had as much a name indeed as cambyses or cæsar

forthis is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires fullas much bolstering as error 
so ignorant are most landsmen of some ofthe plainest and most palpable wonders of the world  that without somehints touching the plain facts  historical and otherwise  of thefishery  they might scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable  or stillworse and more detestable  a hideous and intolerable allegory first  though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the generalperils of the grand fishery  yet they have nothing like a fixed  vividconception of those perils  and the frequency with which they recur one reason perhaps is  that not one in fifty of the actual disastersand deaths by casualties in the fishery  ever finds a public record athome  however transient and immediately forgotten that record 
do yousuppose that that poor fellow there  who this moment perhaps caught bythe whale line off the coast of new guinea  is being carried down tothe bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan do you suppose thatthat poor fellow s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you willread to morrow at your breakfast 
no  because the mails are veryirregular between here and new guinea 
in fact  did you ever hear whatmight be called regular news direct or indirect from new guinea 
yet itell you that upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific among many others we spoke thirty different ships  every one of whichhad had a death by a whale  some of them more than one  and three thathad each lost a boat s crew 
for god s sake  be economical with yourlamps and candles 
not a gallon you burn  but at least one drop ofman s blood was spilled for it secondly  people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whaleis an enormous creature of enormous power  but i have ever found thatwhen narrating to them some specific example of this two foldenormousness  they have significantly complimented me upon myfacetiousness  when  i declare upon my soul  i had no more idea ofbeing facetious than moses  when he wrote the history of the plagues ofegypt but fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upontestimony entirely independent of my own 
that point is this  the spermwhale is in some cases sufficiently powerful  knowing  and judiciouslymalicious  as with direct aforethought to stave in  utterly destroy and sink a large ship  and what is more  the sperm whale has done it first  in the year 1820 the ship essex  captain pollard  of nantucket was cruising in the pacific ocean 
one day she saw spouts  lowered herboats  and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales 
ere long  several ofthe whales were wounded  when  suddenly  a very large whale escapingfrom the boats  issued from the shoal  and bore directly down upon theship 
dashing his forehead against her hull  he so stove her in  thatin less than  ten minutes  she settled down and fell over 
not asurviving plank of her has been seen since 
after the severestexposure  part of the crew reached the land in their boats 
beingreturned home at last  captain pollard once more sailed for the pacificin command of another ship  but the gods shipwrecked him again uponunknown rocks and breakers  for the second time his ship was utterlylost  and forthwith forswearing the sea  he has never tempted it since at this day captain pollard is a resident of nantucket 
i have seenowen chace  who was chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedy i have read his plain and faithful narrative  i have conversed with hisson  and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe 
  the following are extracts from chace s narrative   every fact seemedto warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance whichdirected his operations  he made two several attacks upon the ship  ata short interval between them  both of which  according to theirdirection  were calculated to do us the most injury  by being madeahead  and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for theshock  to effect which  the exact manœuvres which he made werenecessary 
his aspect was most horrible  and such as indicatedresentment and fury 
he came directly from the shoal which we had justbefore entered  and in which we had struck three of his companions  asif fired with revenge for their sufferings   again   at all events  thewhole circumstances taken together  all happening before my own eyes and producing  at the time  impressions in my mind of decided calculating mischief  on the part of the whale  many of whichimpressions i cannot now recall   induce me to be satisfied that i amcorrect in my opinion  here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship  during ablack night in an open boat  when almost despairing of reaching anyhospitable shore 
 the dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing  thefears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest  or dashed uponhidden rocks  with all the other ordinary subjects of fearfulcontemplation  seemed scarcely entitled to a moment s thought  thedismal looking wreck  and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale wholly engrossed my reflections  until day again made its appearance  in another place p 
45  he speaks of  the mysterious and mortal attackof the animal  secondly  the ship union  also of nantucket  was in the year 1807totally lost off the azores by a similar onset  but the authenticparticulars of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounter though from the whale hunters i have now and then heard casualallusions to it thirdly  some eighteen or twenty years ago commodore j    thencommanding an american sloop of war of the first class  happened to bedining with a party of whaling captains  on board a nantucket ship inthe harbor of oahu  sandwich islands 
conversation turning upon whales the commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strengthascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present 
he peremptorilydenied for example  that any whale could so smite his stoutsloop of war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful 
verygood  but there is more coming 
some weeks after  the commodore setsail in this impregnable craft for valparaiso 
but he was stopped onthe way by a portly sperm whale  that begged a few moments confidential business with him 
that business consisted in fetching thecommodore s craft such a thwack  that with all his pumps going he madestraight for the nearest port to heave down and repair 
i am notsuperstitious  but i consider the commodore s interview with that whaleas providential 
was not saul of tarsus converted from unbelief by asimilar fright 
i tell you  the sperm whale will stand no nonsense i will now refer you to langsdorff s voyages for a little circumstancein point  peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof 
langsdorff  youmust know by the way  was attached to the russian admiral krusenstern sfamous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century captain langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter  by the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail  and the next daywe were out in the open sea  on our way to ochotsh 
the weather wasvery clear and fine  but so intolerably cold that we were obliged tokeep on our fur clothing 
for some days we had very little wind  it wasnot till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up an uncommon large whale  the body of which was larger than the shipitself  lay almost at the surface of the water  but was not perceivedby any one on board till the moment when the ship  which was in fullsail  was almost upon him  so that it was impossible to prevent itsstriking against him 
we were thus placed in the most imminent danger as this gigantic creature  setting up its back  raised the ship threefeet at least out of the water 
the masts reeled  and the sails fellaltogether  while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck concluding that we had struck upon some rock  instead of this we sawthe monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity 
captaind wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not thevessel had received any damage from the shock  but we found that veryhappily it had escaped entirely uninjured  now  the captain d wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship inquestion  is a new englander  who  after a long life of unusualadventures as a sea captain  this day resides in the village ofdorchester near boston 
i have the honor of being a nephew of his 
ihave particularly questioned him concerning this passage in langsdorff he substantiates every word 
the ship  however  was by no means a largeone  a russian craft built on the siberian coast  and purchased by myuncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home in that up and down manly book of old fashioned adventure  so full too  of honest wonders the voyage of lionel wafer  one of ancientdampier s old chums i found a little matter set down so like that justquoted from langsdorff  that i cannot forbear inserting it here for acorroborative example  if such be needed lionel  it seems  was on his way to  john ferdinando   as he calls themodern juan fernandes 
 in our way thither   he says   about fouro clock in the morning  when we were about one hundred and fiftyleagues from the main of america  our ship felt a terrible shock  whichput our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell wherethey were or what to think  but every one began to prepare for death and  indeed  the shock was so sudden and violent  that we took it forgranted the ship had struck against a rock  but when the amazement wasa little over  we cast the lead  and sounded  but found no ground 
         the suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in theircarriages  and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks captain davis  who lay with his head on a gun  was thrown out of hiscabin   lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake  andseems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a greatearthquake  somewhere about that time  did actually do great mischiefalong the spanish land 
but i should not much wonder if  in thedarkness of that early hour of the morning  the shock was after allcaused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath i might proceed with several more examples  one way or another known tome  of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale 
in morethan one instance  he has been known  not only to chase the assailingboats back to their ships  but to pursue the ship itself  and longwithstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks 
the english shippusie hall can tell a story on that head  and  as for his strength  letme say  that there have been examples where the lines attached to arunning sperm whale have  in a calm  been transferred to the ship  andsecured there  the whale towing her great hull through the water  as ahorse walks off with a cart 
again  it is very often observed that  ifthe sperm whale  once struck  is allowed time to rally  he then acts not so often with blind rage  as with wilful  deliberate designs ofdestruction to his pursuers  nor is it without conveying some eloquentindication of his character  that upon being attacked he willfrequently open his mouth  and retain it in that dread expansion forseveral consecutive minutes 
but i must be content with only one moreand a concluding illustration  a remarkable and most significant one by which you will not fail to see  that not only is the most marvellousevent in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day  butthat these marvels  like all marvels  are mere repetitions of the ages so that for the millionth time we say amen with solomon verily there isnothing new under the sun in the sixth christian century lived procopius  a christian magistrateof constantinople  in the days when justinian was emperor andbelisarius general 
as many know  he wrote the history of his owntimes  a work every way of uncommon value 
by the best authorities  hehas always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggeratinghistorian  except in some one or two particulars  not at all affectingthe matter presently to be mentioned now  in this history of his  procopius mentions that  during the termof his prefecture at constantinople  a great sea monster was capturedin the neighboring propontis  or sea of marmora  after having destroyedvessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fiftyyears 
a fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily begainsaid 
nor is there any reason it should be 
of what precise speciesthis sea monster was  is not mentioned 
but as he destroyed ships  aswell as for other reasons  he must have been a whale  and i am stronglyinclined to think a sperm whale 
and i will tell you why 
for a longtime i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in themediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it 
even now i amcertain that those seas are not  and perhaps never can be  in thepresent constitution of things  a place for his habitual gregariousresort 
but further investigations have recently proved to me  that inmodern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of thesperm whale in the mediterranean 
i am told  on good authority  that onthe barbary coast  a commodore davis of the british navy found theskeleton of a sperm whale 
now  as a vessel of war readily passesthrough the dardanelles  hence a sperm whale could  by the same route pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis in the propontis  as far as i can learn  none of that peculiarsubstance called brit is to be found  the aliment of the right whale but i have every reason to believe that the food of the spermwhale squid or cuttle fish lurks at the bottom of that sea  becauselarge creatures  but by no means the largest of that sort  have beenfound at its surface 
if  then  you properly put these statementstogether  and reason upon them a bit  you will clearly perceive that according to all human reasoning  procopius s sea monster  that forhalf a century stove the ships of a roman emperor  must in allprobability have been a sperm whale chapter 46 
surmises though  consumed with the hot fire of his purpose  ahab in all histhoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of mobydick  though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to thatone passion  nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature andlong habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman s ways  altogetherto abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage 
or at least ifthis were otherwise  there were not wanting other motives much moreinfluential with him 
it would be refining too much  perhaps  evenconsidering his monomania  to hint that his vindictiveness towards thewhite whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to allsperm whales  and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more hemultiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale wouldprove to be the hated one he hunted 
but if such an hypothesis beindeed exceptionable  there were still additional considerations which though not so strictly according with the wildness of his rulingpassion  yet were by no means incapable of swaying him to accomplish his object ahab must use tools  and of all tools used inthe shadow of the moon  men are most apt to get out of order 
he knew for example  that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects wasover starbuck  yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritualman any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectualmastership  for to the purely spiritual  the intellectual but stand ina sort of corporeal relation 
starbuck s body and starbuck s coercedwill were ahab s  so long as ahab kept his magnet at starbuck s brain still he knew that for all this the chief mate  in his soul  abhorredhis captain s quest  and could he  would joyfully disintegrate himselffrom it  or even frustrate it 
it might be that a long interval wouldelapse ere the white whale was seen 
during that long interval starbuckwould ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against hiscaptain s leadership  unless some ordinary  prudential  circumstantialinfluences were brought to bear upon him 
not only that  but the subtleinsanity of ahab respecting moby dick was noways more significantlymanifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeingthat  for the present  the hunt should in some way be stripped of thatstrange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it  that thefull terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscurebackground  for few men s courage is proof against protractedmeditation unrelieved by action   that when they stood their long nightwatches  his officers and men must have some nearer things to think ofthan moby dick 
for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew hadhailed the announcement of his quest  yet all sailors of all sorts aremore or less capricious and unreliable they live in the varying outerweather  and they inhale its fickleness and when retained for anyobject remote and blank in the pursuit  however promissory of life andpassion in the end  it is above all things requisite that temporaryinterests and employments should intervene and hold them healthilysuspended for the final dash nor was ahab unmindful of another thing 
in times of strong emotionmankind disdain all base considerations  but such times are evanescent the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man  thoughtahab  is sordidness 
granting that the white whale fully incites thehearts of this my savage crew  and playing round their savageness evenbreeds a certain generous knight errantism in them  still  while forthe love of it they give chase to moby dick  they must also have foodfor their more common  daily appetites 
for even the high lifted andchivalric crusaders of old times were not content to traverse twothousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre  withoutcommitting burglaries  picking pockets  and gaining other piousperquisites by the way 
had they been strictly held to their one finaland romantic object that final and romantic object  too many would haveturned from in disgust 
i will not strip these men  thought ahab  ofall hopes of cash aye  cash 
they may scorn cash now  but let somemonths go by  and no perspective promise of it to them  and then thissame quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them  this same cash wouldsoon cashier ahab nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more relatedto ahab personally 
having impulsively  it is probable  and perhapssomewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of thepequod s voyage  ahab was now entirely conscious that  in so doing  hehad indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge ofusurpation  and with perfect impunity  both moral and legal  his crewif so disposed  and to that end competent  could refuse all furtherobedience to him  and even violently wrest from him the command 
fromeven the barely hinted imputation of usurpation  and the possibleconsequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground  ahab mustof course have been most anxious to protect himself 
that protectioncould only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand backed by a heedful  closely calculating attention to every minuteatmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to besubjected to for all these reasons then  and others perhaps too analytic to beverbally developed here  ahab plainly saw that he must still in a gooddegree continue true to the natural  nominal purpose of the pequod svoyage  observe all customary usages  and not only that  but forcehimself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the generalpursuit of his profession be all this as it may  his voice was now often heard hailing the threemast heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look out  and not omitreporting even a porpoise 
this vigilance was not long without reward chapter 47 
the mat maker it was a cloudy  sultry afternoon  the seamen were lazily loungingabout the decks  or vacantly gazing over into the lead coloured waters queequeg and i were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword mat for an additional lashing to our boat

high aloft in the cross treeswas that mad gay header  tashtego 
his body was reaching eagerlyforward  his hand stretched out like a wand  and at brief suddenintervals he continued his cries 
to be sure the same sound was thatvery moment perhaps being heard all over the seas  from hundreds ofwhalemen s look outs perched as high in the air  but from few of thoselungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellouscadence as from tashtego the indian s as he stood hovering over you half suspended in air  so wildly andeagerly peering towards the horizon  you would have thought him someprophet or seer beholding the shadows of fate  and by those wild criesannouncing their coming  there she blows 
she blows 
she blows   where away   on the lee beam  about two miles off 
a school of them  instantly all was commotion the sperm whale blows as a clock ticks  with the same undeviating andreliable uniformity 
and thereby whalemen distinguish this fish fromother tribes of his genus  there go flukes   was now the cry from tashtego  and the whalesdisappeared  quick  steward   cried ahab 
time  dough boy hurried below  glanced at the watch  and reported the exactminute to ahab the ship was now kept away from the wind  and she went gently rollingbefore it 
tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading toleeward  we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance ofour bows 
for that singular craft at times evinced by the sperm whalewhen  sounding with his head in one direction  he nevertheless  whileconcealed beneath the surface  mills round  and swiftly swims off inthe opposite quarter this deceitfulness of his could not now be inaction  for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen bytashtego had been in any way alarmed  or indeed knew at all of ourvicinity 
one of the men selected for shipkeepers that is  those notappointed to the boats  by this time relieved the indian at themain mast head 
the sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down  theline tubs were fixed in their places  the cranes were thrust out  themainyard was backed  and the three boats swung over the sea like threesamphire baskets over high cliffs 
outside of the bulwarks their eagercrews with one hand clung to the rail  while one foot was expectantlypoised on the gunwale 
so look the long line of man of war s men aboutto throw themselves on board an enemy s ship but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that tookevery eye from the whale 
with a start all glared at dark ahab  who wassurrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air chapter 48 
the first lowering the phantoms  for so they then seemed  were flitting on the other sideof the deck  and  with a noiseless celerity  were casting loose thetackles and bands of the boat which swung there 
this boat had alwaysbeen deemed one of the spare boats  though technically called thecaptain s  on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter 
thefigure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart  with one whitetooth evilly protruding from its steel like lips 
a rumpled chinesejacket of black cotton funereally invested him  with wide blacktrowsers of the same dark stuff 
but strangely crowning this ebonnesswas a glistening white plaited turban  the living hair braided andcoiled round and round upon his head 
less swart in aspect  thecompanions of this figure were of that vivid  tiger yellow complexionpeculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the manillas  a racenotorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty  and by some honest whitemariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agentson the water of the devil  their lord  whose counting room they supposeto be elsewhere while yet the wondering ship s company were gazing upon thesestrangers  ahab cried out to the white turbaned old man at their head  all ready there  fedallah   ready   was the half hissed reply  lower away then  d ye hear   shouting across the deck 
 lower awaythere  i say  such was the thunder of his voice  that spite of their amazement themen sprang over the rail  the sheaves whirled round in the blocks  witha wallow  the three boats dropped into the sea  while  with adexterous  off handed daring  unknown in any other vocation  thesailors  goat like  leaped down the rolling ship s side into the tossedboats below hardly had they pulled out from under the ship s lee  when a fourthkeel  coming from the windward side  pulled round under the stern  andshowed the five strangers rowing ahab  who  standing erect in thestern  loudly hailed starbuck  stubb  and flask  to spread themselveswidely  so as to cover a large expanse of water 
but with all theireyes again riveted upon the swart fedallah and his crew  the inmates ofthe other boats obeyed not the command  captain ahab    said starbuck  spread yourselves   cried ahab   give way  all four boats 
thou flask  pull out more to leeward   aye  aye  sir   cheerily cried little king post  sweeping round hisgreat steering oar 
 lay back   addressing his crew  there  there  there again 
there she blows right ahead  boys  layback   never heed yonder yellow boys  archy   oh  i don t mind  em  sir   said archy   i knew it all before now didn t i hear  em in the hold 
and didn t i tell cabaco here of it what say ye  cabaco 
they are stowaways  mr  flask   pull  pull  my fine hearts alive  pull  my children  pull  my littleones   drawlingly and soothingly sighed stubb to his crew  some of whomstill showed signs of uneasiness 
 why don t you break your backbones my boys 
what is it you stare at 
those chaps in yonder boat 
theyare only five more hands come to help us never mind from where the morethe merrier 
pull  then  do pull  never mind the brimstone devils aregood fellows enough 
so  so  there you are now  that s the stroke for athousand pounds  that s the stroke to sweep the stakes 
hurrah for thegold cup of sperm oil  my heroes 
three cheers  men all hearts alive easy  easy  don t be in a hurry don t be in a hurry 
why don t you snapyour oars  you rascals 
bite something  you dogs 
so  so  so then  softly  softly 
that s it that s it

give waythere  give way 
the devil fetch ye  ye ragamuffin rapscallions  ye areall asleep 
stop snoring  ye sleepers  and pull 
pull  will ye 
pull can t ye 
pull  won t ye 
why in the name of gudgeons and ginger cakesdon t ye pull  pull and break something 
pull  and start your eyes out here   whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle   every mother sson of ye draw his knife  and pull with the blade between his teeth that s it that s it 
now ye do something  that looks like it  mysteel bits 
start her start her  my silver spoons 
start her marling spikes  stubb s exordium to his crew is given here at large  because he hadrather a peculiar way of talking to them in general  and especially ininculcating the religion of rowing 
but you must not suppose from thisspecimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passionswith his congregation 
not at all  and therein consisted his chiefpeculiarity 
he would say the most terrific things to his crew  in atone so strangely compounded of fun and fury  and the fury seemed socalculated merely as a spice to the fun  that no oarsman could hearsuch queer invocations without pulling for dear life  and yet pullingfor the mere joke of the thing 
besides he all the time looked so easyand indolent himself  so loungingly managed his steering oar  and sobroadly gaped open mouthed at times that the mere sight of such ayawning commander  by sheer force of contrast  acted like a charm uponthe crew 
then again  stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous  as to put allinferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them in obedience to a sign from ahab  starbuck was now pulling obliquelyacross stubb s bow  and when for a minute or so the two boats werepretty near to each other  stubb hailed the mate  mr 
larboard boat there  ahoy 
a word with ye  sir  if yeplease   halloa   returned starbuck  turning round not a single inch as hespoke  still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew  his face setlike a flint from stubb s  what think ye of those yellow boys  sir   smuggled on board  somehow  before the ship sailed 
 strong  strong boys 
   in a whisper to his crew  then speaking out loud again   a sadbusiness  mr  stubb 
 seethe her  seethe her  my lads

stubb  all for the best 
let all your crew pull strong  come whatwill

this at least is duty  duty and profit hand in hand   aye  aye  i thought as much   soliloquized stubb  when the boatsdiverged   as soon as i clapt eye on  em  i thought so 
aye  and that swhat he went into the after hold for  so often  as dough boy longsuspected 
they were hidden down there 
the white whale s at the bottomof it 
well  well  so be it 
can t be helped 
all right 
give way  men it ain t the white whale to day 
give way  now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instantas the lowering of the boats from the deck  this had not unreasonablyawakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship scompany  but archy s fancied discovery having some time previous gotabroad among them  though indeed not credited then  this had in somesmall measure prepared them for the event 
it took off the extreme edgeof their wonder  and so what with all this and stubb s confident way ofaccounting for their appearance  they were for the time freed fromsuperstitious surmisings  though the affair still left abundant roomfor all manner of wild conjectures as to dark ahab s precise agency inthe matter from the beginning 
for me  i silently recalled themysterious shadows i had seen creeping on board the pequod during thedim nantucket dawn  as well as the enigmatical hintings of theunaccountable elijah meantime  ahab  out of hearing of his officers  having sided thefurthest to windward  was still ranging ahead of the other boats  acircumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him 
those tigeryellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone  like fivetrip hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength  whichperiodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burstboiler out of a mississippi steamer 
as for fedallah  who was seenpulling the harpooneer oar  he had thrown aside his black jacket  anddisplayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above thegunwale  clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the wateryhorizon  while at the other end of the boat ahab  with one arm  like afencer s  thrown half backward into the air  as if to counterbalanceany tendency to trip  ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oaras in a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him 
allat once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remainedfixed  while the boat s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked 
boatand crew sat motionless on the sea 
instantly the three spread boats inthe rear paused on their way 
the whales had irregularly settled bodilydown into the blue  thus giving no distantly discernible token of themovement  though from his closer vicinity ahab had observed it  every man look out along his oars   cried starbuck 
 thou  queequeg stand up  nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow  the savagestood erect there  and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards thespot where the chase had last been descried 
likewise upon the extremestern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level withthe gunwale  starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancinghimself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft  and silentlyeyeing the vast blue eye of the sea not very far distant flask s boat was also lying breathlessly still its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead  astout sort of post rooted in the keel  and rising some two feet abovethe level of the stern platform 
it is used for catching turns with thewhale line 
its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man s hand and standing upon such a base as that  flask seemed perched at themast head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks 
but littleking post was small and short  and at the same time little king postwas full of a large and tall ambition  so that this loggerheadstand point of his did by no means satisfy king post  i can t see three seas off  tip us up an oar there  and let me on tothat  upon this  daggoo  with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way swiftly slid aft  and then erecting himself volunteered his loftyshoulders for a pedestal  good a mast head as any  sir 
will you mount   that i will  and thank ye very much  my fine fellow  only i wish youfifty feet taller  whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of theboat  the gigantic negro  stooping a little  presented his flat palm toflask s foot  and then putting flask s hand on his hearse plumed headand bidding him spring as he himself should toss  with one dexterousfling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders 
and here wasflask now standing  daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with abreastband to lean against and steady himself by at any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondroushabitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erectposture in his boat  even when pitched about by the most riotouslyperverse and cross running seas 
still more strange to see him giddilyperched upon the loggerhead itself  under such circumstances 
but thesight of little flask mounted upon gigantic daggoo was yet morecurious  for sustaining himself with a cool  indifferent  easy unthought of  barbaric majesty  the noble negro to every roll of thesea harmoniously rolled his fine form 
on his broad back  flaxen hairedflask seemed a snow flake 
the bearer looked nobler than the rider though truly vivacious  tumultuous  ostentatious little flask would nowand then stamp with impatience  but not one added heave did he therebygive to the negro s lordly chest 
so have i seen passion and vanitystamping the living magnanimous earth  but the earth did not alter hertides and her seasons for that meanwhile stubb  the third mate  betrayed no such far gazingsolicitudes 
the whales might have made one of their regular soundings not a temporary dive from mere fright  and if that were the case stubb  as his wont in such cases  it seems  was resolved to solace thelanguishing interval with his pipe 
he withdrew it from his hatband where he always wore it aslant like a feather 
he loaded it  and rammedhome the loading with his thumb end  but hardly had he ignited hismatch across the rough sandpaper of his hand  when tashtego  hisharpooneer  whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixedstars  suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry   down  down all  and giveway  there they are  to a landsman  no whale  nor any sign of a herring  would have beenvisible at that moment  nothing but a troubled bit of greenish whitewater  and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it  andsuffusingly blowing off to leeward  like the confused scud from whiterolling billows 
the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled  as itwere  like the air over intensely heated plates of iron 
beneath thisatmospheric waving and curling  and partially beneath a thin layer ofwater  also  the whales were swimming 
seen in advance of all the otherindications  the puffs of vapor they spouted  seemed their forerunningcouriers and detached flying outriders all four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubledwater and air 
but it bade fair to outstrip them  it flew on and on  asa mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from thehills  pull  pull  my good boys   said starbuck  in the lowest possible butintensest concentrated whisper to his men  while the sharp fixed glancefrom his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow  almost seemed as twovisible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses 
he did not say muchto his crew  though  nor did his crew say anything to him 
only thesilence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of hispeculiar whispers  now harsh with command  now soft with entreaty how different the loud little king post 
 sing out and say something my hearties 
roar and pull  my thunderbolts 
beach me  beach me ontheir black backs  boys  only do that for me  and i ll sign over to youmy martha s vineyard plantation  boys  including wife and children boys

o lord  lord 
but i shall go stark  staringmad 
see that white water   and so shouting  he pulled his hatfrom his head  and stamped up and down on it  then picking it up flirted it far off upon the sea  and finally fell to rearing andplunging in the boat s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie  look at that chap now   philosophically drawled stubb  who  with hisunlighted short pipe  mechanically retained between his teeth  at ashort distance  followed after  he s got fits  that flask has 
fits yes  give him fits that s the very word pitch fits into  em 
merrily merrily  hearts alive 
pudding for supper  you know  merry s the word pull  babes pull  sucklings pull  all 
but what the devil are youhurrying about 
softly  softly  and steadily  my men 
only pull  andkeep pulling  nothing more 
crack all your backbones  and bite yourknives in two that s all 
take it easy why don t ye take it easy  isay  and burst all your livers and lungs  but what it was that inscrutable ahab said to that tiger yellow crew ofhis these were words best omitted here  for you live under the blessedlight of the evangelical land 
only the infidel sharks in the audaciousseas may give ear to such words  when  with tornado brow  and eyes ofred murder  and foam glued lips  ahab leaped after his prey meanwhile  all the boats tore on 
the repeated specific allusions offlask to  that whale   as he called the fictitious monster which hedeclared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat s bow with itstail these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life like  thatthey would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful lookover the shoulder 
but this was against all rule  for the oarsmen mustput out their eyes  and ram a skewer through their necks  usagepronouncing that they must have no organs but ears  and no limbs butarms  in these critical moments it was a sight full of quick wonder and awe 
the vast swells of theomnipotent sea  the surging  hollow roar they made  as they rolledalong the eight gunwales  like gigantic bowls in a boundlessbowling green  the brief suspended agony of the boat  as it would tipfor an instant on the knife like edge of the sharper waves  that almostseemed threatening to cut it in two  the sudden profound dip into thewatery glens and hollows  the keen spurrings and goadings to gain thetop of the opposite hill  the headlong  sled like slide down its otherside  all these  with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers  andthe shuddering gasps of the oarsmen  with the wondrous sight of theivory pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails  likea wild hen after her screaming brood  all this was thrilling not the raw recruit  marching from the bosom of his wife into the feverheat of his first battle  not the dead man s ghost encountering thefirst unknown phantom in the other world  neither of these can feelstranger and stronger emotions than that man does  who for the firsttime finds himself pulling into the charmed  churned circle of thehunted sperm whale the dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more andmore visible  owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud shadowsflung upon the sea 
the jets of vapor no longer blended  but tiltedeverywhere to right and left  the whales seemed separating their wakes the boats were pulled more apart  starbuck giving chase to three whalesrunning dead to leeward 
our sail was now set  and  with the stillrising wind  we rushed along  the boat going with such madness throughthe water  that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough toescape being torn from the row locks soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist  neithership nor boat to be seen  give way  men   whispered starbuck  drawing still further aft thesheet of his sail   there is time to kill a fish yet before the squallcomes 
there s white water again  close to 
spring  soon after  two cries in quick succession on each side of us denotedthat the other boats had got fast  but hardly were they overheard  whenwith a lightning like hurtling whisper starbuck said   stand up   andqueequeg  harpoon in hand  sprang to his feet though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death perilso close to them ahead  yet with their eyes on the intense countenanceof the mate in the stern of the boat  they knew that the imminentinstant had come  they heard  too  an enormous wallowing sound as offifty elephants stirring in their litter 
meanwhile the boat was stillbooming through the mist  the waves curling and hissing around us likethe erected crests of enraged serpents  that s his hump 
there  there  give it to him   whisperedstarbuck a short rushing sound leaped out of the boat  it was the darted iron ofqueequeg 
then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push fromastern  while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge  the sailcollapsed and exploded  a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us 
the wholecrew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter skelter into thewhite curdling cream of the squall 
squall  whale  and harpoon had allblended together  and the whale  merely grazed by the iron  escaped though completely swamped  the boat was nearly unharmed 
swimming roundit we picked up the floating oars  and lashing them across the gunwale tumbled back to our places 
there we sat up to our knees in the sea the water covering every rib and plank  so that to our downward gazingeyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from thebottom of the ocean the wind increased to a howl  the waves dashed their bucklers together the whole squall roared  forked  and crackled around us like a whitefire upon the prairie  in which  unconsumed  we were burning  immortalin these jaws of death 
in vain we hailed the other boats  as well roarto the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail thoseboats in that storm 
meanwhile the driving scud  rack  and mist  grewdarker with the shadows of night  no sign of the ship could be seen the rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat 
the oars wereuseless as propellers  performing now the office of life preservers so  cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg  after manyfailures starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern  thenstretching it on a waif pole  handed it to queequeg as thestandard bearer of this forlorn hope 
there  then  he sat  holding upthat imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness 
there then  he sat  the sign and symbol of a man without faith  hopelesslyholding up hope in the midst of despair wet  drenched through  and shivering cold  despairing of ship or boat we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on 
the mist still spread overthe sea  the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat suddenly queequeg started to his feet  hollowing his hand to his ear we all heard a faint creaking  as of ropes and yards hitherto muffledby the storm 
the sound came nearer and nearer  the thick mists weredimly parted by a huge  vague form 
affrighted  we all sprang into thesea as the ship at last loomed into view  bearing right down upon uswithin a distance of not much more than its length floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat  as for one instant ittossed and gaped beneath the ship s bows like a chip at the base of acataract  and then the vast hull rolled over it  and it was seen nomore till it came up weltering astern 
again we swam for it  weredashed against it by the seas  and were at last taken up and safelylanded on board 
ere the squall came close to  the other boats had cutloose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time 
the shiphad given us up  but was still cruising  if haply it might light uponsome token of our perishing  an oar or a lance pole chapter 49 
the hyena there are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixedaffair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vastpractical joke  though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns  and morethan suspects that the joke is at nobody s expense but his own however  nothing dispirits  and nothing seems worth while disputing

that odd sort of wayward mood i amspeaking of  comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation it comes in the very midst of his earnestness  so that what just beforemight have seemed to him a thing most momentous  now seems but a partof the general joke 
there is nothing like the perils of whaling tobreed this free and easy sort of genial  desperado philosophy  and withit i now regarded this whole voyage of the pequod  and the great whitewhale its object  queequeg   said i  when they had dragged me  the last man  to thedeck  and i was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off thewater   queequeg  my fine friend  does this sort of thing oftenhappen   without much emotion  though soaked through just like me  hegave me to understand that such things did often happen  mr 
stubb   said i  turning to that worthy  who  buttoned up in hisoil jacket  was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain   mr 
stubb  ithink i have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met  our chiefmate  mr  starbuck  is by far the most careful and prudent 
i supposethen  that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggysquall is the height of a whaleman s discretion   certain 
i ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale offcape horn   mr 
flask   said i  turning to little king post  who was standingclose by   you are experienced in these things  and i am not 
will youtell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery  mr  flask for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back foremost intodeath s jaws   can t you twist that smaller   said flask 
 yes  that s the law 
ishould like to see a boat s crew backing water up to a whale faceforemost 
ha  ha 
the whale would give them squint for squint  mindthat  here then  from three impartial witnesses  i had a deliberate statementof the entire case 
considering  therefore  that squalls and capsizingsin the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep  were matters ofcommon occurrence in this kind of life  considering that at thesuperlatively critical instant of going on to the whale i must resignmy life into the hands of him who steered the boat oftentimes a fellowwho at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point ofscuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings  considering thatthe particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to beimputed to starbuck s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of asquall  and considering that starbuck  notwithstanding  was famous forhis great heedfulness in the fishery  considering that i belonged tothis uncommonly prudent starbuck s boat  and finally considering inwhat a devil s chase i was implicated  touching the white whale  takingall things together  i say  i thought i might as well go below and makea rough draft of my will 
 queequeg   said i   come along  you shall bemy lawyer  executor  and legatee  it may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering attheir last wills and testaments  but there are no people in the worldmore fond of that diversion 
this was the fourth time in my nauticallife that i had done the same thing 
after the ceremony was concludedupon the present occasion  i felt all the easier  a stone was rolledaway from my heart 
besides  all the days i should now live would be asgood as the days that lazarus lived after his resurrection  asupplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case mightbe 
i survived myself  my death and burial were locked up in my chest i looked round me tranquilly and contentedly  like a quiet ghost with aclean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault now then  thought i  unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock here goes for a cool  collected dive at death and destruction  and thedevil fetch the hindmost chapter 50 
ahab s boat and crew 
fedallah  who would have thought it  flask   cried stubb   if i had but one legyou would not catch me in a boat  unless maybe to stop the plug holewith my timber toe 
he s a wonderful old man   i don t think it so strange  after all  on that account   said flask  if his leg were off at the hip  now  it would be a different thing that would disable him  but he has one knee  and good part of the otherleft  you know   i don t know that  my little man  i never yet saw him kneel  among whale wise people it has often been argued whether  consideringthe paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage  itis right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the activeperils of the chase 
so tamerlane s soldiers often argued with tears intheir eyes  whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carriedinto the thickest of the fight but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect 
considering thatwith two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great andextraordinary difficulties  that every individual moment  indeed  thencomprises a peril  under these circumstances is it wise for any maimedman to enter a whale boat in the hunt 
as a general thing  thejoint owners of the pequod must have plainly thought not ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little ofhis entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes ofthe chase  for the sake of being near the scene of action and givinghis orders in person  yet for captain ahab to have a boat actuallyapportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt above all forcaptain ahab to be supplied with five extra men  as that same boat screw  he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the headsof the owners of the pequod 
therefore he had not solicited a boat screw from them  nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all thatmatter 
until cabaco s published discovery  the sailors had littleforeseen it  though to be sure when  after being a little while out ofport  all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting thewhaleboats for service  when some time after this ahab was now and thenfound bestirring himself in the matter of making thole pins with hisown hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats  and evensolicitously cutting the small wooden skewers  which when the line isrunning out are pinned over the groove in the bow  when all this wasobserved in him  and particularly his solicitude in having an extracoat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat  as if to make it betterwithstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb  and also the anxietyhe evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board  or clumsy cleat  as itis sometimes called  the horizontal piece in the boat s bow for bracingthe knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale  when it wasobserved how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary kneefixed in the semi circular depression in the cleat  and with thecarpenter s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it alittle there  all these things  i say  had awakened much interest andcuriosity at the time 
but almost everybody supposed that thisparticular preparative heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view tothe ultimate chase of moby dick  for he had already revealed hisintention to hunt that mortal monster in person 
but such a suppositiondid by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat s crewbeing assigned to that boat now  with the subordinate phantoms  what wonder remained soon wanedaway  for in a whaler wonders soon wane 
besides  now and then suchunaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknownnooks and ash holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws ofwhalers  and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castawaycreatures found tossing about the open sea on planks  bits of wreck oars  whaleboats  canoes  blown off japanese junks  and what not  thatbeelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabinto chat with the captain  and it would not create any unsubduableexcitement in the forecastle but be all this as it may  certain it is that while the subordinatephantoms soon found their place among the crew  though still as it weresomehow distinct from them  yet that hair turbaned fedallah remained amuffled mystery to the last 
whence he came in a mannerly world likethis  by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to belinked with ahab s peculiar fortunes  nay  so far as to have some sortof a half hinted influence  heaven knows  but it might have been evenauthority over him  all this none knew 
but one cannot sustain anindifferent air concerning fedallah 
he was such a creature ascivilized  domestic people in the temperate zone only see in theirdreams  and that but dimly  but the like of whom now and then glideamong the unchanging asiatic communities  especially the oriental islesto the east of the continent those insulated  immemorial  unalterablecountries  which even in these modern days still preserve much of theghostly aboriginalness of earth s primal generations  when the memoryof the first man was a distinct recollection  and all men hisdescendants  unknowing whence he came  eyed each other as realphantoms  and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created andto what end  when though  according to genesis  the angels indeedconsorted with the daughters of men  the devils also  add theuncanonical rabbins  indulged in mundane amours chapter 51 
the spirit spout days  weeks passed  and under easy sail  the ivory pequod had slowlyswept across four several cruising grounds  that off the azores  offthe cape de verdes  on the plate  so called   being off the mouth ofthe rio de la plata  and the carrol ground  an unstaked  waterylocality  southerly from st  helena it was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene andmoonlight night  when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver and  by their soft  suffusing seethings  made what seemed a silverysilence  not a solitude  on such a silent night a silvery jet was seenfar in advance of the white bubbles at the bow 
lit up by the moon  itlooked celestial  seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising fromthe sea 
fedallah first descried this jet 
for of these moonlightnights  it was his wont to mount to the main mast head  and stand alook out there  with the same precision as if it had been day 
and yet though herds of whales were seen by night  not one whaleman in ahundred would venture a lowering for them 
you may think with whatemotions  then  the seamen beheld this old oriental perched aloft atsuch unusual hours  his turban and the moon  companions in one sky 
butwhen  after spending his uniform interval there for several successivenights without uttering a single sound  when  after all this silence his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery  moon lit jet every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirithad lighted in the rigging  and hailed the mortal crew 
 there sheblows   had the trump of judgment blown  they could not have quiveredmore  yet still they felt no terror  rather pleasure 
for though it wasa most unwonted hour  yet so impressive was the cry  and so deliriouslyexciting  that almost every soul on board instinctively desired alowering walking the deck with quick  side lunging strides  ahab commanded thet gallant sails and royals to be set  and every stunsail spread 
thebest man in the ship must take the helm 
then  with every mast headmanned  the piled up craft rolled down before the wind 
the strange upheaving  lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollowsof so many sails  made the buoyant  hovering deck to feel like airbeneath the feet  while still she rushed along  as if two antagonisticinfluences were struggling in her one to mount direct to heaven  theother to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal 
and had you watchedahab s face that night  you would have thought that in him also twodifferent things were warring 
while his one live leg made livelyechoes along the deck  every stroke of his dead limb sounded like acoffin tap 
on life and death this old man walked 
but though the shipso swiftly sped  and though from every eye  like arrows  the eagerglances shot  yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night 
everysailor swore he saw it once  but not a second time this midnight spout had almost grown a forgotten thing  when  some daysafter  lo 
at the same silent hour  it was again announced  again itwas descried by all  but upon making sail to overtake it  once more itdisappeared as if it had never been 
and so it served us night afternight  till no one heeded it but to wonder at it 
mysteriously jettedinto the clear moonlight  or starlight  as the case might be disappearing again for one whole day  or two days  or three  andsomehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing stillfurther and further in our van  this solitary jet seemed for everalluring us on nor with the immemorial superstition of their race  and in accordancewith the preternaturalness  as it seemed  which in many things investedthe pequod  were there wanting some of the seamen who swore thatwhenever and wherever descried  at however remote times  or in howeverfar apart latitudes and longitudes  that unnearable spout was cast byone self same whale  and that whale  moby dick 
for a time  therereigned  too  a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition  asif it were treacherously beckoning us on and on  in order that themonster might turn round upon us  and rend us at last in the remotestand most savage seas these temporary apprehensions  so vague but so awful  derived awondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather  inwhich  beneath all its blue blandness  some thought there lurked adevilish charm  as for days and days we voyaged along  through seas sowearily  lonesomely mild  that all space  in repugnance to our vengefulerrand  seemed vacating itself of life before our urn like prow but  at last  when turning to the eastward  the cape winds beganhowling around us  and we rose and fell upon the long  troubled seasthat are there  when the ivory tusked pequod sharply bowed to theblast  and gored the dark waves in her madness  till  like showers ofsilver chips  the foam flakes flew over her bulwarks  then all thisdesolate vacuity of life went away  but gave place to sights moredismal than before close to our bows  strange forms in the water darted hither and thitherbefore us  while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea ravens 
andevery morning  perched on our stays  rows of these birds were seen  andspite of our hootings  for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp as though they deemed our ship some drifting  uninhabited craft  athing appointed to desolation  and therefore fit roosting place fortheir homeless selves 
and heaved and heaved  still unrestingly heavedthe black sea  as if its vast tides were a conscience  and the greatmundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and sufferingit had bred cape of good hope  do they call ye 
rather cape tormentoso  as calledof yore  for long allured by the perfidious silences that before hadattended us  we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea  whereguilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish  seemedcondemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store  or beatthat black air without any horizon 
but calm  snow white  andunvarying  still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky  stillbeckoning us on from before  the solitary jet would at times bedescried during all this blackness of the elements  ahab  though assuming forthe time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerousdeck  manifested the gloomiest reserve  and more seldom than everaddressed his mates 
in tempestuous times like these  after everythingabove and aloft has been secured  nothing more can be done butpassively to await the issue of the gale 
then captain and crew becomepractical fatalists 
so  with his ivory leg inserted into itsaccustomed hole  and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud  ahab forhours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward  while anoccasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his veryeyelashes together 
meantime  the crew driven from the forward part ofthe ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist  and the better toguard against the leaping waves  each man had slipped himself into asort of bowline secured to the rail  in which he swung as in a loosenedbelt 
few or no words were spoken  and the silent ship  as if manned bypainted sailors in wax  day after day tore on through all the swiftmadness and gladness of the demoniac waves 
by night the same mutenessof humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed  still in silencethe men swung in the bowlines  still wordless ahab stood up to theblast 
even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would notseek that repose in his hammock 
never could starbuck forget the oldman s aspect  when one night going down into the cabin to mark how thebarometer stood  he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in hisfloor screwed chair  the rain and half melted sleet of the storm fromwhich he had some time before emerged  still slowly dripping from theunremoved hat and coat 
on the table beside him lay unrolled one ofthose charts of tides and currents which have previously been spokenof 
his lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand 
though the bodywas erect  the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes werepointed towards the needle of the tell tale that swung from a beam inthe ceiling 
  the cabin compass is called the tell tale  because without going tothe compass at the helm  the captain  while below  can inform himselfof the course of the ship terrible old man 
thought starbuck with a shudder  sleeping in thisgale  still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose chapter 52 
the albatross south eastward from the cape  off the distant crozetts  a good cruisingground for right whalemen  a sail loomed ahead  the goney  albatross by name 
as she slowly drew nigh  from my lofty perch at thefore mast head  i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyroin the far ocean fisheries a whaler at sea  and long absent from home as if the waves had been fullers  this craft was bleached like theskeleton of a stranded walrus 
all down her sides  this spectralappearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust  while allher spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furredover with hoar frost 
only her lower sails were set 
a wild sight itwas to see her long bearded look outs at those three mast heads 
theyseemed clad in the skins of beasts  so torn and bepatched the raimentthat had survived nearly four years of cruising 
standing in iron hoopsnailed to the mast  they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea  andthough  when the ship slowly glided close under our stern  we six menin the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leapedfrom the mast heads of one ship to those of the other  yet  thoseforlorn looking fishermen  mildly eyeing us as they passed  said notone word to our own look outs  while the quarter deck hail was beingheard from below  ship ahoy 
have ye seen the white whale  but as the strange captain  leaning over the pallid bulwarks  was inthe act of putting his trumpet to his mouth  it somehow fell from hishand into the sea  and the wind now rising amain  he in vain strove tomake himself heard without it 
meantime his ship was still increasingthe distance between 
while in various silent ways the seamen of thepequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at thefirst mere mention of the white whale s name to another ship  ahab fora moment paused  it almost seemed as though he would have lowered aboat to board the stranger  had not the threatening wind forbade 
buttaking advantage of his windward position  he again seized his trumpet and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a nantucketerand shortly bound home  he loudly hailed  ahoy there 
this is thepequod  bound round the world 
tell them to address all future lettersto the pacific ocean 
and this time three years  if i am not at home tell them to address them to    at that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed  and instantly  then in accordance with their singular ways  shoals of small harmless fish that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side darted away with what seemed shuddering fins  and ranged themselvesfore and aft with the stranger s flanks 
though in the course of hiscontinual voyagings ahab must often before have noticed a similarsight  yet  to any monomaniac man  the veriest trifles capriciouslycarry meanings  swim away from me  do ye   murmured ahab  gazing over into the water there seemed but little in the words  but the tone conveyed more ofdeep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced but turning to the steersman  who thus far had been holding the ship inthe wind to diminish her headway  he cried out in his old lionvoice   up helm 
keep her off round the world  round the world 
there is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct 
only throughnumberless perils to the very point whence we started  where those thatwe left behind secure  were all the time before us were this world an endless plain  and by sailing eastward we could forever reach new distances  and discover sights more sweet and strangethan any cyclades or islands of king solomon  then there were promisein the voyage 
but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of  or intormented chase of that demon phantom that  some time or other  swimsbefore all human hearts  while chasing such over this round globe  theyeither lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed chapter 53 
the gam the ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whaler we hadspoken was this  the wind and sea betokened storms 
but even had thisnot been the case  he would not after all  perhaps  have boardedher judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions if so it hadbeen that  by the process of hailing  he had obtained a negative answerto the question he put 
for  as it eventually turned out  he cared notto consort  even for five minutes  with any stranger captain  except hecould contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought 
butall this might remain inadequately estimated  were not something saidhere of the peculiar usages of whaling vessels when meeting each otherin foreign seas  and especially on a common cruising ground if two strangers crossing the pine barrens in new york state  or theequally desolate salisbury plain in england  if casually encounteringeach other in such inhospitable wilds  these twain  for the life ofthem  cannot well avoid a mutual salutation  and stopping for a momentto interchange the news  and  perhaps  sitting down for a while andresting in concert  then  how much more natural that upon theillimitable pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea  two whalingvessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth off lonefanning s island  or the far away king s mills  how much more natural i say  that under such circumstances these ships should not onlyinterchange hails  but come into still closer  more friendly andsociable contact 
and especially would this seem to be a matter ofcourse  in the case of vessels owned in one seaport  and whosecaptains  officers  and not a few of the men are personally known toeach other  and consequently  have all sorts of dear domestic things totalk about for the long absent ship  the outward bounder  perhaps  has letters onboard  at any rate  she will be sure to let her have some papers of adate a year or two later than the last one on her blurred andthumb worn files 
and in return for that courtesy  the outward boundship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from thecruising ground to which she may be destined  a thing of the utmostimportance to her 
and in degree  all this will hold true concerningwhaling vessels crossing each other s track on the cruising grounditself  even though they are equally long absent from home 
for one ofthem may have received a transfer of letters from some third  and nowfar remote vessel  and some of those letters may be for the people ofthe ship she now meets 
besides  they would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable chat 
for not only would they meet with all thesympathies of sailors  but likewise with all the peculiarcongenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually sharedprivations and perils nor would difference of country make any very essential difference that is  so long as both parties speak one language  as is the casewith americans and english 
though  to be sure  from the small numberof english whalers  such meetings do not very often occur  and whenthey do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them for your englishman is rather reserved  and your yankee  he does notfancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself 
besides  the englishwhalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over theamerican whalers  regarding the long  lean nantucketer  with hisnondescript provincialisms  as a sort of sea peasant 
but where thissuperiority in the english whalemen does really consist  it would behard to say  seeing that the yankees in one day  collectively  killmore whales than all the english  collectively  in ten years 
but thisis a harmless little foible in the english whale hunters  which thenantucketer does not take much to heart  probably  because he knowsthat he has a few foibles himself so  then  we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea  thewhalers have most reason to be sociable and they are so 
whereas  somemerchant ships crossing each other s wake in the mid atlantic  willoftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition mutually cutting each other on the high seas  like a brace of dandiesin broadway  and all the time indulging  perhaps  in finical criticismupon each other s rig 
as for men of war  when they chance to meet atsea  they first go through such a string of silly bowings andscrapings  such a ducking of ensigns  that there does not seem to bemuch right down hearty good will and brotherly love about it at all 
astouching slave ships meeting  why  they are in such a prodigious hurry they run away from each other as soon as possible 
and as for pirates when they chance to cross each other s cross bones  the first hailis  how many skulls   the same way that whalers hail  how manybarrels   and that question once answered  pirates straightway steerapart  for they are infernal villains on both sides  and don t like tosee overmuch of each other s villanous likenesses but look at the godly  honest  unostentatious  hospitable  sociable free and easy whaler 
what does the whaler do when she meets anotherwhaler in any sort of decent weather 
she has a  gam   a thing soutterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the nameeven  and if by chance they should hear of it  they only grin at it and repeat gamesome stuff about  spouters  and  blubber boilers   andsuch like pretty exclamations 
why it is that all merchant seamen  andalso all pirates and man of war s men  and slave ship sailors  cherishsuch a scornful feeling towards whale ships  this is a question itwould be hard to answer 
because  in the case of pirates  say  i shouldlike to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar gloryabout it 
it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation  indeed  but only atthe gallows 
and besides  when a man is elevated in that odd fashion he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude 
hence  iconclude  that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on but what is a gam  you might wear out your index finger running upand down the columns of dictionaries  and never find the word 
dr johnson never attained to that erudition  noah webster s ark does nothold it 
nevertheless  this same expressive word has now for many yearsbeen in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankees certainly  it needs a definition  and should be incorporated into thelexicon 
with that view  let me learnedly define it gam 
noun a social meeting of two  or more  whaleships  generallyon a cruising ground  when  after exchanging hails  they exchangevisits by boats  crews  the two captains remaining  for the time  onboard of one ship  and the two chief mates on the other there is another little item about gamming which must not be forgottenhere 
all professions have their own little peculiarities of detail  sohas the whale fishery 
in a pirate  man of war  or slave ship  when thecaptain is rowed anywhere in his boat  he always sits in the sternsheets on a comfortable  sometimes cushioned seat there  and oftensteers himself with a pretty little milliner s tiller decorated withgay cords and ribbons 
but the whale boat has no seat astern  no sofaof that sort whatever  and no tiller at all 
high times indeed  ifwhaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty oldaldermen in patent chairs 
and as for a tiller  the whale boat neveradmits of any such effeminacy  and therefore as in gamming a completeboat s crew must leave the ship  and hence as the boat steerer orharpooneer is of the number  that subordinate is the steersman upon theoccasion  and the captain  having no place to sit in  is pulled off tohis visit all standing like a pine tree 
and often you will notice thatbeing conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on himfrom the sides of the two ships  this standing captain is all alive tothe importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs 
noris this any very easy matter  for in his rear is the immense projectingsteering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back  theafter oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front 
he is thuscompletely wedged before and behind  and can only expand himselfsideways by settling down on his stretched legs  but a sudden  violentpitch of the boat will often go far to topple him  because length offoundation is nothing without corresponding breadth 
merely make aspread angle of two poles  and you cannot stand them up 
then  again it would never do in plain sight of the world s riveted eyes  it wouldnever do  i say  for this straddling captain to be seen steadyinghimself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with hishands  indeed  as token of his entire  buoyant self command  hegenerally carries his hands in his trowsers  pockets  but perhaps beinggenerally very large  heavy hands  he carries them there for ballast nevertheless there have occurred instances  well authenticated onestoo  where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical momentor two  in a sudden squall say to seize hold of the nearest oarsman shair  and hold on there like grim death chapter 54 
the town ho s story 
 as told at the golden inn  the cape of good hope  and all the watery region round about there  ismuch like some noted four corners of a great highway  where you meetmore travellers than in any other part it was not very long after speaking the goney that anotherhomeward bound whaleman  the town ho   was encountered 
she was mannedalmost wholly by polynesians 
in the short gam that ensued she gave usstrong news of moby dick 
to some the general interest in the whitewhale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the town ho sstory  which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certainwondrous  inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments ofgod which at times are said to overtake some men 
this lattercircumstance  with its own particular accompaniments  forming what maybe called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated  neverreached the ears of captain ahab or his mates 
for that secret part ofthe story was unknown to the captain of the town ho himself 
it was theprivate property of three confederate white seamen of that ship  one ofwhom  it seems  communicated it to tashtego with romish injunctions ofsecrecy  but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep  andrevealed so much of it in that way  that when he was wakened he couldnot well withhold the rest 
nevertheless  so potent an influence didthis thing have on those seamen in the pequod who came to the fullknowledge of it  and by such a strange delicacy  to call it so  werethey governed in this matter  that they kept the secret amongthemselves so that it never transpired abaft the pequod s main mast interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story aspublicly narrated on the ship  the whole of this strange affair i nowproceed to put on lasting record 
 the ancient whale cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast head still used by whalemen in hunting the famous gallipagos terrapin for my humor s sake  i shall preserve the style in which i oncenarrated it at lima  to a lounging circle of my spanish friends  onesaint s eve  smoking upon the thick gilt tiled piazza of the goldeninn 
of those fine cavaliers  the young dons  pedro and sebastian  wereon the closer terms with me  and hence the interluding questions theyoccasionally put  and which are duly answered at the time  some two years prior to my first learning the events which i am aboutrehearsing to you  gentlemen  the town ho  sperm whaler of nantucket was cruising in your pacific here  not very many days  sail eastwardfrom the eaves of this good golden inn 
she was somewhere to thenorthward of the line 
one morning upon handling the pumps  accordingto daily usage  it was observed that she made more water in her holdthan common 
they supposed a sword fish had stabbed her  gentlemen 
butthe captain  having some unusual reason for believing that rare goodluck awaited him in those latitudes  and therefore being very averse toquit them  and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous though  indeed  they could not find it after searching the hold as lowdown as was possible in rather heavy weather  the ship still continuedher cruisings  the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easyintervals  but no good luck came  more days went by  and not only wasthe leak yet undiscovered  but it sensibly increased 
so much so  thatnow taking some alarm  the captain  making all sail  stood away for thenearest harbor among the islands  there to have his hull hove out andrepaired  though no small passage was before her  yet  if the commonest chancefavoured  he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by theway  because his pumps were of the best  and being periodicallyrelieved at them  those six and thirty men of his could easily keep theship free  never mind if the leak should double on her 
in truth  wellnigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperousbreezes  the town ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety ather port without the occurrence of the least fatality  had it not beenfor the brutal overbearing of radney  the mate  a vineyarder  and thebitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt  a lakeman and desperado frombuffalo   lakeman  buffalo 
pray  what is a lakeman  and where is buffalo  said don sebastian  rising in his swinging mat of grass  on the eastern shore of our lake erie  don  but i crave yourcourtesy may be  you shall soon hear further of all that 
now gentlemen  in square sail brigs and three masted ships  well nigh aslarge and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old callao to farmanilla  this lakeman  in the land locked heart of our america  had yetbeen nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularlyconnected with the open ocean 
for in their interflowing aggregate those grand fresh water seas of ours  erie  and ontario  and huron  andsuperior  and michigan  possess an ocean like expansiveness  with manyof the ocean s noblest traits  with many of its rimmed varieties ofraces and of climes 
they contain round archipelagoes of romanticisles  even as the polynesian waters do  in large part  are shored bytwo great contrasting nations  as the atlantic is  they furnish longmaritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east dotted all round their banks  here and there are frowned upon bybatteries  and by the goat like craggy guns of lofty mackinaw  theyhave heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories  at intervals  theyyield their beaches to wild barbarians  whose red painted faces flashfrom out their peltry wigwams  for leagues and leagues are flanked byancient and unentered forests  where the gaunt pines stand like serriedlines of kings in gothic genealogies  those same woods harboring wildafric beasts of prey  and silken creatures whose exported furs giverobes to tartar emperors  they mirror the paved capitals of buffalo andcleveland  as well as winnebago villages  they float alike thefull rigged merchant ship  the armed cruiser of the state  the steamer and the beech canoe  they are swept by borean and dismasting blasts asdireful as any that lash the salted wave  they know what shipwrecksare  for out of sight of land  however inland  they have drowned fullmany a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew 
thus  gentlemen though an inlander  steelkilt was wild ocean born  and wild oceannurtured  as much of an audacious mariner as any 
and for radney though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucketbeach  to nurse at his maternal sea  though in after life he had longfollowed our austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific  yet washe quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoodsseaman  fresh from the latitudes of buck horn handled bowie knives 
yetwas this nantucketer a man with some good hearted traits  and thislakeman  a mariner  who though a sort of devil indeed  might yet byinflexible firmness  only tempered by that common decency of humanrecognition which is the meanest slave s right  thus treated  thissteelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile 
at all events  hehad proved so thus far  but radney was doomed and made mad  andsteelkilt but  gentlemen  you shall hear  it was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing herprow for her island haven  that the town ho s leak seemed againincreasing  but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumpsevery day 
you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like ouratlantic  for example  some skippers think little of pumping theirwhole way across it  though of a still  sleepy night  should theofficer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect  theprobability would be that he and his shipmates would never againremember it  on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward gentlemen  is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at theirpump handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length that is  if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast  or if any otherreasonable retreat is afforded them 
it is only when a leaky vessel isin some very out of the way part of those waters  some really landlesslatitude  that her captain begins to feel a little anxious  much this way had it been with the town ho  so when her leak was foundgaining once more  there was in truth some small concern manifested byseveral of her company  especially by radney the mate 
he commanded theupper sails to be well hoisted  sheeted home anew  and every wayexpanded to the breeze 
now this radney  i suppose  was as little of acoward  and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensivenesstouching his own person as any fearless  unthinking creature on land oron sea that you can conveniently imagine  gentlemen 
therefore when hebetrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship  some of theseamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part ownerin her 
so when they were working that evening at the pumps  there wason this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them  as theystood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clearwater  clear as any mountain spring  gentlemen that bubbling from thepumps ran across the deck  and poured itself out in steady spouts atthe lee scupper holes  now  as you well know  it is not seldom the case in this conventionalworld of ours watery or otherwise  that when a person placed in commandover his fellow men finds one of them to be very significantly hissuperior in general pride of manhood  straightway against that man heconceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness  and if he have achance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern s tower  and makea little heap of dust of it 
be this conceit of mine as it may gentlemen  at all events steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with ahead like a roman  and a flowing golden beard like the tasseledhousings of your last viceroy s snorting charger  and a brain  and aheart  and a soul in him  gentlemen  which had made steelkiltcharlemagne  had he been born son to charlemagne s father 
but radney the mate  was ugly as a mule  yet as hardy  as stubborn  as malicious he did not love steelkilt  and steelkilt knew it  espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with therest  the lakeman affected not to notice him  but unawed  went on withhis gay banterings   aye  aye  my merry lads  it s a lively leak this  hold a cannikin one of ye  and let s have a taste 
by the lord  it s worth bottling 
itell ye what  men  old rad s investment must go for it 
he had best cutaway his part of the hull and tow it home 
the fact is  boys  thatsword fish only began the job  he s come back again with a gang ofship carpenters  saw fish  and file fish  and what not  and the wholeposse of  em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom making improvements  i suppose 
if old rad were here now  i d tell himto jump overboard and scatter  em 
they re playing the devil with hisestate  i can tell him 
but he s a simple old soul  rad  and a beautytoo 
boys  they say the rest of his property is invested inlooking glasses 
i wonder if he d give a poor devil like me the modelof his nose    damn your eyes 
what s that pump stopping for   roared radney pretending not to have heard the sailors  talk 
 thunder away at it    aye  aye  sir   said steelkilt  merry as a cricket 
 lively  boys lively  now   and with that the pump clanged like fifty fire engines the men tossed their hats off to it  and ere long that peculiar gaspingof the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life sutmost energies  quitting the pump at last  with the rest of his band  the lakeman wentforward all panting  and sat himself down on the windlass  his facefiery red  his eyes bloodshot  and wiping the profuse sweat from hisbrow 
now what cozening fiend it was  gentlemen  that possessed radneyto meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state  i knownot  but so it happened 
intolerably striding along the deck  the matecommanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks  and also ashovel  and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing apig to run at large  now  gentlemen  sweeping a ship s deck at sea is a piece of householdwork which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to everyevening  it has been known to be done in the case of ships actuallyfoundering at the time 
such  gentlemen  is the inflexibility ofsea usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen  some of whomwould not willingly drown without first washing their faces 
but in allvessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys if boys there be aboard 
besides  it was the stronger men in thetown ho that had been divided into gangs  taking turns at the pumps and being the most athletic seaman of them all  steelkilt had beenregularly assigned captain of one of the gangs  consequently he shouldhave been freed from any trivial business not connected with trulynautical duties  such being the case with his comrades 
i mention allthese particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affairstood between the two men  but there was more than this  the order about the shovel was almost asplainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt  as though radney had spatin his face 
any man who has gone sailor in a whale ship willunderstand this  and all this and doubtless much more  the lakemanfully comprehended when the mate uttered his command 
but as he satstill for a moment  and as he steadfastly looked into the mate smalignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder casks heaped up in himand the slow match silently burning along towards them  as heinstinctively saw all this  that strange forbearance and unwillingnessto stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being arepugnance most felt  when felt at all  by really valiant men even whenaggrieved this nameless phantom feeling  gentlemen  stole oversteelkilt  therefore  in his ordinary tone  only a little broken by the bodilyexhaustion he was temporarily in  he answered him saying that sweepingthe deck was not his business  and he would not do it 
and then without at all alluding to the shovel  he pointed to three lads as thecustomary sweepers  who  not being billeted at the pumps  had donelittle or nothing all day 
to this  radney replied with an oath  in amost domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating hiscommand  meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman  with anuplifted cooper s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask nearby  heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps  forall his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkiltcould but ill brook this bearing in the mate  but somehow stillsmothering the conflagration within him  without speaking he remaineddoggedly rooted to his seat  till at last the incensed radney shook thehammer within a few inches of his face  furiously commanding him to dohis bidding  steelkilt rose  and slowly retreating round the windlass  steadilyfollowed by the mate with his menacing hammer  deliberately repeatedhis intention not to obey 
seeing  however  that his forbearance hadnot the slightest effect  by an awful and unspeakable intimation withhis twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man  but itwas to no purpose 
and in this way the two went once slowly round thewindlass  when  resolved at last no longer to retreat  bethinking himthat he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor  thelakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer   mr 
radney  i will not obey you 
take that hammer away  or look toyourself   but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him  wherethe lakeman stood fixed  now shook the heavy hammer within an inch ofhis teeth  meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions retreating not the thousandth part of an inch  stabbing him in the eyewith the unflinching poniard of his glance  steelkilt  clenching hisright hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back  told hispersecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he  steelkilt  wouldmurder him 
but  gentlemen  the fool had been branded for the slaughterby the gods 
immediately the hammer touched the cheek  the next instantthe lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head  he fell on the hatchspouting blood like a whale  ere the cry could go aft steelkilt was shaking one of the backstaysleading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing theirmastheads 
they were both canallers   canallers   cried don pedro 
 we have seen many whale ships in ourharbours  but never heard of your canallers 
pardon  who and what arethey    canallers  don  are the boatmen belonging to our grand erie canal you must have heard of it    nay  senor  hereabouts in this dull  warm  most lazy  and hereditaryland  we know but little of your vigorous north    aye 
well then  don  refill my cup 
your chicha s very fine  and ereproceeding further i will tell ye what our canallers are  for suchinformation may throw side light upon my story   for three hundred and sixty miles  gentlemen  through the entirebreadth of the state of new york  through numerous populous cities andmost thriving villages  through long  dismal  uninhabited swamps  andaffluent  cultivated fields  unrivalled for fertility  by billiard roomand bar room  through the holy of holies of great forests  on romanarches over indian rivers  through sun and shade  by happy hearts orbroken  through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble mohawkcounties  and especially  by rows of snow white chapels  whose spiresstand almost like milestones  flows one continual stream of venetianlycorrupt and often lawless life 
there s your true ashantee  gentlemen there howl your pagans  where you ever find them  next door to you under the long flung shadow  and the snug patronising lee of churches for by some curious fatality  as it is often noted of your metropolitanfreebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice  sosinners  gentlemen  most abound in holiest vicinities   is that a friar passing   said don pedro  looking downwards into thecrowded plazza  with humorous concern   well for our northern friend  dame isabella s inquisition wanes inlima   laughed don sebastian 
 proceed  senor    a moment 
pardon   cried another of the company 
 in the name of allus limeese  i but desire to express to you  sir sailor  that we have byno means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present lima fordistant venice in your corrupt comparison 
do not bow and looksurprised  you know the proverb all along this coast  corrupt as lima  it but bears out your saying  too  churches more plentiful thanbilliard tables  and for ever open and  corrupt as lima   so  too venice  i have been there  the holy city of the blessed evangelist  st mark  st 
dominic  purge it 
your cup 
thanks  here i refill  now  youpour out again   freely depicted in his own vocation  gentlemen  the canaller wouldmake a fine dramatic hero  so abundantly and picturesquely wicked ishe 
like mark antony  for days and days along his green turfed  flowerynile  he indolently floats  openly toying with his red cheekedcleopatra  ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck 
but ashore all this effeminacy is dashed 
the brigandish guise which the canallerso proudly sports  his slouched and gaily ribboned hat betoken hisgrand features 
a terror to the smiling innocence of the villagesthrough which he floats  his swart visage and bold swagger are notunshunned in cities 
once a vagabond on his own canal  i have receivedgood turns from one of these canallers  i thank him heartily  wouldfain be not ungrateful  but it is often one of the prime redeemingqualities of your man of violence  that at times he has as stiff an armto back a poor stranger in a strait  as to plunder a wealthy one 
insum  gentlemen  what the wildness of this canal life is  isemphatically evinced by this  that our wild whale fishery contains somany of its most finished graduates  and that scarce any race ofmankind  except sydney men  are so much distrusted by our whalingcaptains 
nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along itsline  the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the soletransition between quietly reaping in a christian corn field  andrecklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas   i see 
i see   impetuously exclaimed don pedro  spilling his chichaupon his silvery ruffles 
 no need to travel 
the world s one lima 
ihad thought  now  that at your temperate north the generations werecold and holy as the hills  but the story   i left off  gentlemen  where the lakeman shook the backstay 
hardlyhad he done so  when he was surrounded by the three junior mates andthe four harpooneers  who all crowded him to the deck 
but sliding downthe ropes like baleful comets  the two canallers rushed into theuproar  and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt  and a twistedturmoil ensued  while standing out of harm s way  the valiant captaindanced up and down with a whale pike  calling upon his officers tomanhandle that atrocious scoundrel  and smoke him along to thequarter deck 
at intervals  he ran close up to the revolving border ofthe confusion  and prying into the heart of it with his pike  sought toprick out the object of his resentment 
but steelkilt and hisdesperadoes were too much for them all  they succeeded in gaining theforecastle deck  where  hastily slewing about three or four large casksin a line with the windlass  these sea parisians entrenched themselvesbehind the barricade   come out of that  ye pirates   roared the captain  now menacing themwith a pistol in each hand  just brought to him by the steward 
 comeout of that  ye cut throats   steelkilt leaped on the barricade  and striding up and down there defied the worst the pistols could do  but gave the captain tounderstand distinctly  that his  steelkilt s  death would be the signalfor a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands 
fearing in his heartlest this might prove but too true  the captain a little desisted  butstill commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty   will you promise not to touch us  if we do   demanded theirringleader   turn to 
turn to  i make no promise  to your duty 
do you want tosink the ship  by knocking off at a time like this 
turn to   and heonce more raised a pistol   sink the ship   cried steelkilt 
 aye  let her sink 
not a man of usturns to  unless you swear not to raise a rope yarn against us 
whatsay ye  men   turning to his comrades 
a fierce cheer was theirresponse  the lakeman now patrolled the barricade  all the while keeping his eyeon the captain  and jerking out such sentences as these   it s not ourfault  we didn t want it  i told him to take his hammer away  it wasboy s business  he might have known me before this  i told him not toprick the buffalo  i believe i have broken a finger here against hiscursed jaw  ain t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there men 
look to those handspikes  my hearties 
captain  by god  look toyourself  say the word  don t be a fool  forget it all  we are ready toturn to  treat us decently  and we re your men  but we won t beflogged    turn to 
i make no promises  turn to  i say    look ye  now   cried the lakeman  flinging out his arm towards him  there are a few of us here  and i am one of them  who have shipped forthe cruise  d ye see  now as you well know  sir  we can claim ourdischarge as soon as the anchor is down  so we don t want a row  it snot our interest  we want to be peaceable  we are ready to work  but wewon t be flogged    turn to   roared the captain  steelkilt glanced round him a moment  and then said   i tell you whatit is now  captain  rather than kill ye  and be hung for such a shabbyrascal  we won t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us  but tillyou say the word about not flogging us  we don t do a hand s turn    down into the forecastle then  down with ye  i ll keep ye there tillye re sick of it 
down ye go    shall we   cried the ringleader to his men 
most of them were againstit  but at length  in obedience to steelkilt  they preceded him downinto their dark den  growlingly disappearing  like bears into a cave  as the lakeman s bare head was just level with the planks  the captainand his posse leaped the barricade  and rapidly drawing over the slideof the scuttle  planted their group of hands upon it  and loudly calledfor the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to thecompanionway 
then opening the slide a little  the captain whisperedsomething down the crack  closed it  and turned the key upon them tenin number leaving on deck some twenty or more  who thus far hadremained neutral  all night a wide awake watch was kept by all the officers  forward andaft  especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway  atwhich last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge  afterbreaking through the bulkhead below 
but the hours of darkness passedin peace  the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at thepumps  whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the drearynight dismally resounded through the ship  at sunrise the captain went forward  and knocking on the deck summoned the prisoners to work  but with a yell they refused 
water wasthen lowered down to them  and a couple of handfuls of biscuit weretossed after it  when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it the captain returned to the quarter deck 
twice every day for threedays this was repeated  but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling and then a scuffling was heard  as the customary summons was delivered and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle  saying they wereready to turn to 
the fetid closeness of the air  and a famishing diet united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution  had constrainedthem to surrender at discretion 
emboldened by this  the captainreiterated his demand to the rest  but steelkilt shouted up to him aterrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where hebelonged 
on the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted upinto the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrainthem 
only three were left   better turn to  now   said the captain with a heartless jeer   shut us up again  will ye   cried steelkilt   oh certainly   said the captain  and the key clicked  it was at this point  gentlemen  that enraged by the defection ofseven of his former associates  and stung by the mocking voice that hadlast hailed him  and maddened by his long entombment in a place asblack as the bowels of despair  it was then that steelkilt proposed tothe two canallers  thus far apparently of one mind with him  to burstout of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison  and armed withtheir keen mincing knives  long  crescentic  heavy implements with ahandle at each end  run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail  and ifby any devilishness of desperation possible  seize the ship 
forhimself  he would do this  he said  whether they joined him or not that was the last night he should spend in that den 
but the scheme metwith no opposition on the part of the other two  they swore they wereready for that  or for any other mad thing  for anything in short but asurrender 
and what was more  they each insisted upon being the firstman on deck  when the time to make the rush should come 
but to thistheir leader as fiercely objected  reserving that priority for himself particularly as his two comrades would not yield  the one to the other in the matter  and both of them could not be first  for the ladderwould but admit one man at a time 
and here  gentlemen  the foul playof these miscreants must come out  upon hearing the frantic project of their leader  each in his ownseparate soul had suddenly lighted  it would seem  upon the same pieceof treachery  namely  to be foremost in breaking out  in order to bethe first of the three  though the last of the ten  to surrender  andthereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct mightmerit 
but when steelkilt made known his determination still to leadthem to the last  they in some way  by some subtle chemistry ofvillany  mixed their before secret treacheries together  and when theirleader fell into a doze  verbally opened their souls to each other inthree sentences  and bound the sleeper with cords  and gagged him withcords  and shrieked out for the captain at midnight  thinking murder at hand  and smelling in the dark for the blood  heand all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle 
in afew minutes the scuttle was opened  and  bound hand and foot  the stillstruggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidiousallies  who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had beenfully ripe for murder 
but all these were collared  and dragged alongthe deck like dead cattle  and  side by side  were seized up into themizzen rigging  like three quarters of meat  and there they hung tillmorning 
 damn ye   cried the captain  pacing to and fro before them  the vultures would not touch ye  ye villains   at sunrise he summoned all hands  and separating those who hadrebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny  he told theformer that he had a good mind to flog them all round thought  upon thewhole  he would do so he ought to justice demanded it  but for thepresent  considering their timely surrender  he would let them go witha reprimand  which he accordingly administered in the vernacular   but as for you  ye carrion rogues   turning to the three men in therigging  for you  i mean to mince ye up for the try pots   and  seizinga rope  he applied it with all his might to the backs of the twotraitors  till they yelled no more  but lifelessly hung their headssideways  as the two crucified thieves are drawn   my wrist is sprained with ye   he cried  at last   but there is stillrope enough left for you  my fine bantam  that wouldn t give up 
takethat gag from his mouth  and let us hear what he can say for himself   for a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of hiscramped jaws  and then painfully twisting round his head  said in asort of hiss   what i say is this and mind it well if you flog me  imurder you    say ye so 
then see how ye frighten me  and the captain drew off withthe rope to strike   best not   hissed the lakeman   but i must   and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke  steelkilt here hissed out something  inaudible to all but the captain who  to the amazement of all hands  started back  paced the deckrapidly two or three times  and then suddenly throwing down his rope said   i won t do it let him go cut him down  d ye hear   but as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order  a paleman  with a bandaged head  arrested them radney the chief mate 
eversince the blow  he had lain in his berth  but that morning  hearing thetumult on the deck  he had crept out  and thus far had watched thewhole scene 
such was the state of his mouth  that he could hardlyspeak  but mumbling something about his being willing and able to dowhat the captain dared not attempt  he snatched the rope and advancedto his pinioned foe   you are a coward   hissed the lakeman   so i am  but take that   the mate was in the very act of striking when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm 
he paused  and then pausingno more  made good his word  spite of steelkilt s threat  whatever thatmight have been 
the three men were then cut down  all hands wereturned to  and  sullenly worked by the moody seamen  the iron pumpsclanged as before  just after dark that day  when one watch had retired below  a clamorwas heard in the forecastle  and the two trembling traitors running up besieged the cabin door  saying they durst not consort with the crew entreaties  cuffs  and kicks could not drive them back  so at their owninstance they were put down in the ship s run for salvation 
still  nosign of mutiny reappeared among the rest 
on the contrary  it seemed that mainly at steelkilt s instigation  they had resolved to maintainthe strictest peacefulness  obey all orders to the last  and  when theship reached port  desert her in a body 
but in order to insure thespeediest end to the voyage  they all agreed to another thing namely not to sing out for whales  in case any should be discovered 
for spite of her leak  and spite of all her other perils  the town ho stillmaintained her mast heads  and her captain was just as willing to lowerfor a fish that moment  as on the day his craft first struck thecruising ground  and radney the mate was quite as ready to change hisberth for a boat  and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death thevital jaw of the whale  but though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort ofpassiveness in their conduct  he kept his own counsel  at least tillall was over  concerning his own proper and private revenge upon theman who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart 
he was in radneythe chief mate s watch  and as if the infatuated man sought to run morethan half way to meet his doom  after the scene at the rigging  heinsisted  against the express counsel of the captain  upon resuming thehead of his watch at night 
upon this  and one or two othercircumstances  steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge  during the night  radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on thebulwarks of the quarter deck  and leaning his arm upon the gunwale ofthe boat which was hoisted up there  a little above the ship s side 
inthis attitude  it was well known  he sometimes dozed 
there was aconsiderable vacancy between the boat and the ship  and down betweenthis was the sea 
steelkilt calculated his time  and found that hisnext trick at the helm would come round at two o clock  in the morningof the third day from that in which he had been betrayed 
at hisleisure  he employed the interval in braiding something very carefullyin his watches below   what are you making there   said a shipmate   what do you think 
what does it look like    like a lanyard for your bag  but it s an odd one  seems to me    yes  rather oddish   said the lakeman  holding it at arm s lengthbefore him   but i think it will answer 
shipmate  i haven t enoughtwine  have you any   but there was none in the forecastle   then i must get some from old rad   and he rose to go aft   you don t mean to go a begging to him   said a sailor   why not 
do you think he won t do me a turn  when it s to helphimself in the end  shipmate   and going to the mate  he looked at himquietly  and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock 
it was givenhim neither twine nor lanyard were seen again  but the next night aniron ball  closely netted  partly rolled from the pocket of thelakeman s monkey jacket  as he was tucking the coat into his hammockfor a pillow 
twenty four hours after  his trick at the silenthelm nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always readydug to the seaman s hand that fatal hour was then to come  and in thefore ordaining soul of steelkilt  the mate was already stark andstretched as a corpse  with his forehead crushed in  but  gentlemen  a fool saved the would be murderer from the bloodydeed he had planned 
yet complete revenge he had  and without being theavenger 
for by a mysterious fatality  heaven itself seemed to step into take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would havedone  it was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the secondday  when they were washing down the decks  that a stupid teneriffeman  drawing water in the main chains  all at once shouted out   thereshe rolls 
there she rolls   jesu  what a whale 
it was moby dick   moby dick   cried don sebastian   st 
sir sailor  but dowhales have christenings 
whom call you moby dick    a very white  and famous  and most deadly immortal monster  don  butthat would be too long a story    how 
how   cried all the young spaniards  crowding   nay  dons  dons nay  nay 
i cannot rehearse that now 
let me get moreinto the air  sirs    the chicha 
the chicha   cried don pedro   our vigorous friend looksfaint  fill up his empty glass   no need  gentlemen  one moment  and i proceed  now  gentlemen  sosuddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of theship forgetful of the compact among the crew in the excitement of themoment  the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily liftedhis voice for the monster  though for some little time past it had beenplainly beheld from the three sullen mast heads 
all was now a phrensy  the white whale the white whale   was the cry from captain  mates  andharpooneers  who  undeterred by fearful rumours  were all anxious tocapture so famous and precious a fish  while the dogged crew eyedaskance  and with curses  the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun  shifted and glistened like aliving opal in the blue morning sea 
gentlemen  a strange fatalitypervades the whole career of these events  as if verily mapped outbefore the world itself was charted 
the mutineer was the bowsman ofthe mate  and when fast to a fish  it was his duty to sit next him while radney stood up with his lance in the prow  and haul in orslacken the line  at the word of command 
moreover  when the four boatswere lowered  the mate s got the start  and none howled more fiercelywith delight than did steelkilt  as he strained at his oar 
after astiff pull  their harpooneer got fast  and  spear in hand  radneysprang to the bow 
he was always a furious man  it seems  in a boat and now his bandaged cry was  to beach him on the whale s topmost back nothing loath  his bowsman hauled him up and up  through a blindingfoam that blent two whitenesses together  till of a sudden the boatstruck as against a sunken ledge  and keeling over  spilled out thestanding mate 
that instant  as he fell on the whale s slippery back the boat righted  and was dashed aside by the swell  while radney wastossed over into the sea  on the other flank of the whale 
he struckout through the spray  and  for an instant  was dimly seen through thatveil  wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of moby dick 
butthe whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom  seized the swimmerbetween his jaws  and rearing high up with him  plunged headlong again and went down  meantime  at the first tap of the boat s bottom  the lakeman hadslackened the line  so as to drop astern from the whirlpool  calmlylooking on  he thought his own thoughts 
but a sudden  terrific downward jerking of the boat  quickly brought his knife to the line 
hecut it  and the whale was free 
but  at some distance  moby dick roseagain  with some tatters of radney s red woollen shirt  caught in theteeth that had destroyed him 
all four boats gave chase again  but thewhale eluded them  and finally wholly disappeared  in good time  the town ho reached her port a savage  solitaryplace where no civilized creature resided 
there  headed by thelakeman  all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately desertedamong the palms  eventually  as it turned out  seizing a large doublewar canoe of the savages  and setting sail for some other harbor  the ship s company being reduced to but a handful  the captain calledupon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heavingdown the ship to stop the leak 
but to such unresting vigilance overtheir dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated  bothby night and by day  and so extreme was the hard work they underwent that upon the vessel being ready again for sea  they were in such aweakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in soheavy a vessel 
after taking counsel with his officers  he anchored theship as far off shore as possible  loaded and ran out his two cannonfrom the bows  stacked his muskets on the poop  and warning theislanders not to approach the ship at their peril  took one man withhim  and setting the sail of his best whale boat  steered straightbefore the wind for tahiti  five hundred miles distant  to procure areinforcement to his crew  on the fourth day of the sail  a large canoe was descried  whichseemed to have touched at a low isle of corals 
he steered away fromit  but the savage craft bore down on him  and soon the voice ofsteelkilt hailed him to heave to  or he would run him under water 
thecaptain presented a pistol 
with one foot on each prow of the yokedwar canoes  the lakeman laughed him to scorn  assuring him that if thepistol so much as clicked in the lock  he would bury him in bubbles andfoam   what do you want of me   cried the captain   where are you bound 
and for what are you bound   demanded steelkilt  no lies    i am bound to tahiti for more men    very good 
let me board you a moment i come in peace   with that heleaped from the canoe  swam to the boat  and climbing the gunwale stood face to face with the captain   cross your arms  sir  throw back your head 
now  repeat after me 
assoon as steelkilt leaves me  i swear to beach this boat on yonderisland  and remain there six days 
if i do not  may lightnings strikeme    a pretty scholar   laughed the lakeman 
 adios  senor   and leapinginto the sea  he swam back to his comrades  watching the boat till it was fairly beached  and drawn up to theroots of the cocoa nut trees  steelkilt made sail again  and in duetime arrived at tahiti  his own place of destination 
there  luckbefriended him  two ships were about to sail for france  and wereprovidentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailorheaded 
they embarked  and so for ever got the start of their formercaptain  had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution  some ten days after the french ships sailed  the whale boat arrived and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilizedtahitians  who had been somewhat used to the sea 
chartering a smallnative schooner  he returned with them to his vessel  and finding allright there  again resumed his cruisings  where steelkilt now is  gentlemen  none know  but upon the island ofnantucket  the widow of radney still turns to the sea which refuses togive up its dead  still in dreams sees the awful white whale thatdestroyed him 
         are you through   said don sebastian  quietly   i am  don    then i entreat you  tell me if to the best of your own convictions this your story is in substance really true 
it is so passingwonderful 
did you get it from an unquestionable source 
bear with meif i seem to press    also bear with all of us  sir sailor  for we all join in donsebastian s suit   cried the company  with exceeding interest   is there a copy of the holy evangelists in the golden inn gentlemen    nay   said don sebastian   but i know a worthy priest near by  whowill quickly procure one for me 
i go for it  but are you well advised this may grow too serious    will you be so good as to bring the priest also  don    though there are no auto da fés in lima now   said one of the companyto another   i fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy let us withdraw more out of the moonlight 
i see no need of this    excuse me for running after you  don sebastian  but may i also begthat you will be particular in procuring the largest sized evangelistsyou can               this is the priest  he brings you the evangelists   said donsebastian  gravely  returning with a tall and solemn figure   let me remove my hat 
now  venerable priest  further into the light and hold the holy book before me that i may touch it   so help me heaven  and on my honor the story i have told ye gentlemen  is in substance and its great items  true 
i know it to betrue  it happened on this ball  i trod the ship  i knew the crew  ihave seen and talked with steelkilt since the death of radney   chapter 55 
of the monstrous pictures of whales i shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to theeye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is mooredalongside the whale ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there it may be worth while  therefore  previously to advert to those curiousimaginary portraits of him which even down to the present dayconfidently challenge the faith of the landsman 
it is time to set theworld right in this matter  by proving such pictures of the whale allwrong it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions willbe found among the oldest hindoo  egyptian  and grecian sculptures 
forever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marblepanellings of temples  the pedestals of statues  and on shields medallions  cups  and coins  the dolphin was drawn in scales ofchain armor like saladin s  and a helmeted head like st  george s  eversince then has something of the same sort of license prevailed  notonly in most popular pictures of the whale  but in many scientificpresentations of him now  by all odds  the most ancient extant portrait anyways purportingto be the whale s  is to be found in the famous cavern pagoda ofelephanta  in india 
the brahmins maintain that in the almost endlesssculptures of that immemorial pagoda  all the trades and pursuits every conceivable avocation of man  were prefigured ages before any ofthem actually came into being 
no wonder then  that in some sort ournoble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth 
thehindoo whale referred to  occurs in a separate department of the wall depicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan  learnedlyknown as the matse avatar 
but though this sculpture is half man andhalf whale  so as only to give the tail of the latter  yet that smallsection of him is all wrong 
it looks more like the tapering tail of ananaconda  than the broad palms of the true whale s majestic flukes but go to the old galleries  and look now at a great christianpainter s portrait of this fish  for he succeeds no better than theantediluvian hindoo 
it is guido s picture of perseus rescuingandromeda from the sea monster or whale 
where did guido get the modelof such a strange creature as that 
nor does hogarth  in painting thesame scene in his own  perseus descending   make out one whit better the huge corpulence of that hogarthian monster undulates on thesurface  scarcely drawing one inch of water 
it has a sort of howdah onits back  and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows arerolling  might be taken for the traitors  gate leading from the thamesby water into the tower 
then  there are the prodromus whales of oldscotch sibbald  and jonah s whale  as depicted in the prints of oldbibles and the cuts of old primers 
what shall be said of these 
as forthe book binder s whale winding like a vine stalk round the stock of adescending anchor as stamped and gilded on the backs and title pages ofmany books both old and new that is a very picturesque but purelyfabulous creature  imitated  i take it  from the like figures onantique vases 
though universally denominated a dolphin  i neverthelesscall this book binder s fish an attempt at a whale  because it was sointended when the device was first introduced 
it was introduced by anold italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century  during therevival of learning  and in those days  and even down to acomparatively late period  dolphins were popularly supposed to be aspecies of the leviathan in the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books youwill at times meet with very curious touches at the whale  where allmanner of spouts  jets d eau  hot springs and cold  saratoga andbaden baden  come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain 
in thetitle page of the original edition of the  advancement of learning  youwill find some curious whales but quitting all these unprofessional attempts  let us glance at thosepictures of leviathan purporting to be sober  scientific delineations by those who know 
in old harris s collection of voyages there are someplates of whales extracted from a dutch book of voyages  a d  1671 entitled  a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in thewhale  peter peterson of friesland  master   in one of those plates thewhales  like great rafts of logs  are represented lying amongice isles  with white bears running over their living backs 
in anotherplate  the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale withperpendicular flukes then again  there is an imposing quarto  written by one captaincolnett  a post captain in the english navy  entitled  a voyage roundcape horn into the south seas  for the purpose of extending thespermaceti whale fisheries   in this book is an outline purporting tobe a  picture of a physeter or spermaceti whale  drawn by scale fromone killed on the coast of mexico  august  1793  and hoisted on deck  i doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for thebenefit of his marines 
to mention but one thing about it  let me saythat it has an eye which applied  according to the accompanying scale to a full grown sperm whale  would make the eye of that whale abow window some five feet long 
ah  my gallant captain  why did ye notgive us jonah looking out of that eye nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for thebenefit of the young and tender  free from the same heinousness ofmistake 
look at that popular work  goldsmith s animated nature   inthe abridged london edition of 1807  there are plates of an alleged whale  and a  narwhale   i do not wish to seem inelegant  but thisunsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow  and  as for thenarwhale  one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one  that in thisnineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine uponany intelligent public of schoolboys then  again  in 1825  bernard germain  count de lacépède  a greatnaturalist  published a scientific systemized whale book  wherein areseveral pictures of the different species of the leviathan 
all theseare not only incorrect  but the picture of the mysticetus or greenlandwhale  that is to say  the right whale   even scoresby  a longexperienced man as touching that species  declares not to have itscounterpart in nature but the placing of the cap sheaf to all this blundering business wasreserved for the scientific frederick cuvier  brother to the famousbaron 
in 1836  he published a natural history of whales  in which hegives what he calls a picture of the sperm whale 
before showing thatpicture to any nantucketer  you had best provide for your summaryretreat from nantucket 
in a word  frederick cuvier s sperm whale isnot a sperm whale  but a squash 
of course  he never had the benefit ofa whaling voyage  such men seldom have   but whence he derived thatpicture  who can tell 
perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessorin the same field  desmarest  got one of his authentic abortions  thatis  from a chinese drawing 
and what sort of lively lads with thepencil those chinese are  many queer cups and saucers inform us as for the sign painters  whales seen in the streets hanging over theshops of oil dealers  what shall be said of them 
they are generallyrichard iii 
whales  with dromedary humps  and very savage breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts  that is whaleboats full ofmariners  their deformities floundering in seas of blood and bluepaint but these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so verysurprising after all 
most of the scientific drawings havebeen taken from the stranded fish  and these are about as correct as adrawing of a wrecked ship  with broken back  would correctly representthe noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars though elephants have stood for their full lengths  the livingleviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait 
theliving whale  in his full majesty and significance  is only to be seenat sea in unfathomable waters  and afloat the vast bulk of him is outof sight  like a launched line of battle ship  and out of that elementit is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodilyinto the air  so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations and  not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contourbetween a young sucking whale and a full grown platonian leviathan yet  even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to aship s deck  such is then the outlandish  eel like  limbered  varyingshape of him  that his precise expression the devil himself could notcatch but it may be fancied  that from the naked skeleton of the strandedwhale  accurate hints may be derived touching his true form 
not atall 
for it is one of the more curious things about this leviathan that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape 
thoughjeremy bentham s skeleton  which hangs for candelabra in the library ofone of his executors  correctly conveys the idea of a burly browedutilitarian old gentleman  with all jeremy s other leading personalcharacteristics  yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from anyleviathan s articulated bones 
in fact  as the great hunter says  themere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fullyinvested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that soroundingly envelopes it 
this peculiarity is strikingly evinced in thehead  as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown 
it isalso very curiously displayed in the side fin  the bones of whichalmost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand  minus only thethumb 
this fin has four regular bone fingers  the index  middle  ring and little finger 
but all these are permanently lodged in their fleshycovering  as the human fingers in an artificial covering 
 howeverrecklessly the whale may sometimes serve us   said humorous stubb oneday   he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens  for all these reasons  then  any way you may look at it  you must needsconclude that the great leviathan is that one creature in the worldwhich must remain unpainted to the last 
true  one portrait may hit themark much nearer than another  but none can hit it with any veryconsiderable degree of exactness 
so there is no earthly way of findingout precisely what the whale really looks like 
and the only mode inwhich you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour  is bygoing a whaling yourself  but by so doing  you run no small risk ofbeing eternally stove and sunk by him 
wherefore  it seems to me youhad best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching thisleviathan chapter 56 
of the less erroneous pictures of whales  and the truepictures of whaling scenes in connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales  i am stronglytempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of themwhich are to be found in certain books  both ancient and modern especially in pliny  purchas  hackluyt  harris  cuvier  etc 
but i passthat matter by i know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whale colnett s  huggins s  frederick cuvier s  and beale s 
in the previouschapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to 
huggins s is farbetter than theirs  but  by great odds  beale s is the best 
allbeale s drawings of this whale are good  excepting the middle figure inthe picture of three whales in various attitudes  capping his secondchapter 
his frontispiece  boats attacking sperm whales  though nodoubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men  isadmirably correct and life like in its general effect 
some of thesperm whale drawings in j  ross browne are pretty correct in contour but they are wretchedly engraved 
that is not his fault though of the right whale  the best outline pictures are in scoresby  but theyare drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression 
he hasbut one picture of whaling scenes  and this is a sad deficiency because it is by such pictures only  when at all well done  that youcan derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen byhis living hunters but  taken for all in all  by far the finest  though in some detailsnot the most correct  presentations of whales and whaling scenes to beanywhere found  are two large french engravings  well executed  andtaken from paintings by one garnery 
respectively  they representattacks on the sperm and right whale 
in the first engraving a noblesperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might  just risen beneaththe boat from the profundities of the ocean  and bearing high in theair upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks 
the prow ofthe boat is partially unbroken  and is drawn just balancing upon themonster s spine  and standing in that prow  for that one singleincomputable flash of time  you behold an oarsman  half shrouded by theincensed boiling spout of the whale  and in the act of leaping  as iffrom a precipice 
the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good andtrue 
the half emptied line tub floats on the whitened sea  the woodenpoles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it  the heads of theswimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressionsof affright  while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearingdown upon the scene 
serious fault might be found with the anatomicaldetails of this whale  but let that pass  since  for the life of me  icould not draw so good a one in the second engraving  the boat is in the act of drawing alongsidethe barnacled flank of a large running right whale  that rolls hisblack weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock slide from thepatagonian cliffs 
his jets are erect  full  and black like soot  sothat from so abounding a smoke in the chimney  you would think theremust be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below 
sea fowls arepecking at the small crabs  shell fish  and other sea candies andmaccaroni  which the right whale sometimes carries on his pestilentback 
and all the while the thick lipped leviathan is rushing throughthe deep  leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake  andcausing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nighthe paddle wheels of an ocean steamer 
thus  the foreground is allraging commotion  but behind  in admirable artistic contrast  is theglassy level of a sea becalmed  the drooping unstarched sails of thepowerless ship  and the inert mass of a dead whale  a conqueredfortress  with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale poleinserted into his spout hole who garnery the painter is  or was  i know not 
but my life for it hewas either practically conversant with his subject  or elsemarvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman 
the french are thelads for painting action 
go and gaze upon all the paintings of europe and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathingcommotion on canvas  as in that triumphal hall at versailles  where thebeholder fights his way  pell mell  through the consecutive greatbattles of france  where every sword seems a flash of the northernlights  and the successive armed kings and emperors dash by  like acharge of crowned centaurs 
not wholly unworthy of a place in thatgallery  are these sea battle pieces of garnery the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness ofthings seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravingsthey have of their whaling scenes 
with not one tenth of england sexperience in the fishery  and not the thousandth part of that of theamericans  they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the onlyfinished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of thewhale hunt 
for the most part  the english and american whaledraughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanicaloutline of things  such as the vacant profile of the whale  which  sofar as picturesqueness of effect is concerned  is about tantamount tosketching the profile of a pyramid 
even scoresby  the justly renownedright whaleman  after giving us a stiff full length of the greenlandwhale  and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales andporpoises  treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks chopping knives  and grapnels  and with the microscopic diligence of aleuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety sixfac similes of magnified arctic snow crystals 
i mean no disparagementto the excellent voyager  i honor him for a veteran   but in soimportant a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procuredfor every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a greenland justice ofthe peace in addition to those fine engravings from garnery  there are two otherfrench engravings worthy of note  by some one who subscribes himself h 
durand   one of them  though not precisely adapted to our presentpurpose  nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts 
it is a quietnoon scene among the isles of the pacific  a french whaler anchored inshore  in a calm  and lazily taking water on board  the loosenedsails of the ship  and the long leaves of the palms in the background both drooping together in the breezeless air 
the effect is very fine when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermenunder one of their few aspects of oriental repose 
the other engravingis quite a different affair  the ship hove to upon the open sea  and inthe very heart of the leviathanic life  with a right whale alongside the vessel  in the act of cutting in  hove over to the monster as if toa quay  and a boat  hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity is about giving chase to whales in the distance 
the harpoons andlances lie levelled for use  three oarsmen are just setting the mast inits hole  while from a sudden roll of the sea  the little craft standshalf erect out of the water  like a rearing horse 
from the ship  thesmoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smokeover a village of smithies  and to windward  a black cloud  rising upwith earnest of squalls and rains  seems to quicken the activity of theexcited seamen chapter 57 
of whales in paint  in teeth  in wood  in sheet iron  instone  in mountains  in stars on tower hill  as you go down to the london docks  you may have seen acrippled beggar  or kedger  as the sailors say  holding a paintedboard before him  representing the tragic scene in which he lost hisleg 
there are three whales and three boats  and one of the boats presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity  isbeing crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale 
any time these tenyears  they tell me  has that man held up that picture  and exhibitedthat stump to an incredulous world 
but the time of his justificationhas now come 
his three whales are as good whales as were everpublished in wapping  at any rate  and his stump as unquestionable astump as any you will find in the western clearings 
but  though forever mounted on that stump  never a stump speech does the poor whalemanmake  but  with downcast eyes  stands ruefully contemplating his ownamputation throughout the pacific  and also in nantucket  and new bedford  and sagharbor  you will come across lively sketches of whales andwhaling scenes  graven by the fishermen themselves on spermwhale teeth  or ladies  busks wrought out of the right whale bone  andother like skrimshander articles  as the whalemen call the numerouslittle ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the roughmaterial  in their hours of ocean leisure 
some of them have littleboxes of dentistical looking implements  specially intended for theskrimshandering business 
but  in general  they toil with theirjack knives alone  and  with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor they will turn you out anything you please  in the way of a mariner sfancy long exile from christendom and civilization inevitably restores a manto that condition in which god placed him  i e  what is calledsavagery 
your true whale hunter is as much a savage as an iroquois 
imyself am a savage  owning no allegiance but to the king of thecannibals  and ready at any moment to rebel against him now  one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestichours  is his wonderful patience of industry 
an ancient hawaiianwar club or spear paddle  in its full multiplicity and elaboration ofcarving  is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a latin lexicon for  with but a bit of broken sea shell or a shark s tooth  thatmiraculous intricacy of wooden net work has been achieved  and it hascost steady years of steady application as with the hawaiian savage  so with the white sailor savage 
with thesame marvellous patience  and with the same single shark s tooth  ofhis one poor jack knife  he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture  notquite as workmanlike  but as close packed in its maziness of design  asthe greek savage  achilles s shield  and full of barbaric spirit andsuggestiveness  as the prints of that fine old dutch savage  albertdurer wooden whales  or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs ofthe noble south sea war wood  are frequently met with in theforecastles of american whalers 
some of them are done with muchaccuracy at some old gable roofed country houses you will see brass whales hungby the tail for knockers to the road side door 
when the porter issleepy  the anvil headed whale would be best 
but these knocking whalesare seldom remarkable as faithful essays 
on the spires of someold fashioned churches you will see sheet iron whales placed there forweather cocks  but they are so elevated  and besides that are to allintents and purposes so labelled with  hands off   you cannot examinethem closely enough to decide upon their merit in bony  ribby regions of the earth  where at the base of high brokencliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of theleviathan partly merged in grass  which of a windy day breaks againstthem in a surf of green surges then  again  in mountainous countries where the traveller iscontinually girdled by amphitheatrical heights  here and there fromsome lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of theprofiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges 
but you must bea thorough whaleman  to see these sights  and not only that  but if youwish to return to such a sight again  you must be sure and take theexact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand point else so chance like are such observations of the hills  that yourprecise  previous stand point would require a laborious re discovery like the soloma islands  which still remain incognita  though oncehigh ruffed mendanna trod them and old figuera chronicled them nor when expandingly lifted by your subject  can you fail to trace outgreat whales in the starry heavens  and boats in pursuit of them  aswhen long filled with thoughts of war the eastern nations saw armieslocked in battle among the clouds 
thus at the north have i chasedleviathan round and round the pole with the revolutions of the brightpoints that first defined him to me 
and beneath the effulgentantarctic skies i have boarded the argo navis  and joined the chaseagainst the starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus andthe flying fish with a frigate s anchors for my bridle bitts and fasces of harpoons forspurs  would i could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies  tosee whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents reallylie encamped beyond my mortal sight chapter 58 
brit steering north eastward from the crozetts  we fell in with vast meadowsof brit  the minute  yellow substance  upon which the right whalelargely feeds 
for leagues and leagues it undulated round us  so thatwe seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and goldenwheat on the second day  numbers of right whales were seen  who  secure fromthe attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod  with open jaws sluggishlyswam through the brit  which  adhering to the fringing fibres of thatwondrous venetian blind in their mouths  was in that manner separatedfrom the water that escaped at the lip as morning mowers  who side by side slowly and seethingly advance theirscythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads  even so thesemonsters swam  making a strange  grassy  cutting sound  and leavingbehind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea 
  that part of the sea known among whalemen as the  brazil banks  doesnot bear that name as the banks of newfoundland do  because of therebeing shallows and soundings there  but because of this remarkablemeadow like appearance  caused by the vast drifts of brit continuallyfloating in those latitudes  where the right whale is often chased but it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which atall reminded one of mowers 
seen from the mast heads  especially whenthey paused and were stationary for a while  their vast black formslooked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else 
and as inthe great hunting countries of india  the stranger at a distance willsometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing themto be such  taking them for bare  blackened elevations of the soil even so  often  with him  who for the first time beholds this speciesof the leviathans of the sea 
and even when recognised at last  theirimmense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that suchbulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct  in all parts  withthe same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse indeed  in other respects  you can hardly regard any creatures of thedeep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore 
for thoughsome old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land areof their kind in the sea  and though taking a broad general view of thething  this may very well be  yet coming to specialties  where  forexample  does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers tothe sagacious kindness of the dog 
the accursed shark alone can in anygeneric respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him but though  to landsmen in general  the native inhabitants of the seashave ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial andrepelling  though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita so that columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover hisone superficial western one  though  by vast odds  the most terrific ofall mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallentens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters though but a moment s consideration will teach  that however baby manmay brag of his science and skill  and however much  in a flatteringfuture  that science and skill may augment  yet for ever and for ever to the crack of doom  the sea will insult and murder him  and pulverizethe stateliest  stiffest frigate he can make  nevertheless  by thecontinual repetition of these very impressions  man has lost that senseof the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it the first boat we read of  floated on an ocean  that with portuguesevengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow that same ocean rolls now  that same ocean destroyed the wrecked shipsof last year 
yea  foolish mortals  noah s flood is not yet subsided two thirds of the fair world it yet covers wherein differ the sea and the land  that a miracle upon one is not amiracle upon the other 
preternatural terrors rested upon the hebrews when under the feet of korah and his company the live ground opened andswallowed them up for ever  yet not a modern sun ever sets  but inprecisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews but not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it  but itis also a fiend to its own off spring  worse than the persian host whomurdered his own guests  sparing not the creatures which itself hathspawned 
like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays herown cubs  so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against therocks  and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks ofships 
no mercy  no power but its own controls it 
panting and snortinglike a mad battle steed that has lost its rider  the masterless oceanoverruns the globe consider the subtleness of the sea  how its most dreaded creaturesglide under water  unapparent for the most part  and treacherouslyhidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure 
consider also the devilishbrilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes  as thedainty embellished shape of many species of sharks 
consider  oncemore  the universal cannibalism of the sea  all whose creatures preyupon each other  carrying on eternal war since the world began consider all this  and then turn to this green  gentle  and most docileearth  consider them both  the sea and the land  and do you not find astrange analogy to something in yourself 
for as this appalling oceansurrounds the verdant land  so in the soul of man there lies oneinsular tahiti  full of peace and joy  but encompassed by all thehorrors of the half known life

squid slowly wading through the meadows of brit  the pequod still held on herway north eastward towards the island of java  a gentle air impellingher keel  so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall taperingmasts mildly waved to that languid breeze  as three mild palms on aplain 
and still  at wide intervals in the silvery night  the lonely alluring jet would be seen but one transparent blue morning  when a stillness almost preternaturalspread over the sea  however unattended with any stagnant calm  whenthe long burnished sun glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laidacross them  enjoining some secrecy  when the slippered waves whisperedtogether as they softly ran on  in this profound hush of the visiblesphere a strange spectre was seen by daggoo from the main mast head in the distance  a great white mass lazily rose  and rising higher andhigher  and disentangling itself from the azure  at last gleamed beforeour prow like a snow slide  new slid from the hills 
thus glisteningfor a moment  as slowly it subsided  and sank 
then once more arose and silently gleamed 
it seemed not a whale  and yet is this moby dick thought daggoo 
again the phantom went down  but on re appearing oncemore  with a stiletto like cry that startled every man from his nod the negro yelled out  there 
there again 
there she breaches 
the white whale  the white whale  upon this  the seamen rushed to the yard arms  as in swarming time thebees rush to the boughs 
bare headed in the sultry sun  ahab stood onthe bowsprit  and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wavehis orders to the helmsman  cast his eager glance in the directionindicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of daggoo whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet hadgradually worked upon ahab  so that he was now prepared to connect theideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particularwhale he pursued  however this was  or whether his eagerness betrayedhim  whichever way it might have been  no sooner did he distinctlyperceive the white mass  than with a quick intensity he instantly gaveorders for lowering the four boats were soon on the water  ahab s in advance  and allswiftly pulling towards their prey 
soon it went down  and while  withoars suspended  we were awaiting its reappearance  lo 
in the same spotwhere it sank  once more it slowly rose 
almost forgetting for themoment all thoughts of moby dick  we now gazed at the most wondrousphenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind 
avast pulpy mass  furlongs in length and breadth  of a glancingcream colour  lay floating on the water  innumerable long armsradiating from its centre  and curling and twisting like a nest ofanacondas  as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach no perceptible face or front did it have  no conceivable token ofeither sensation or instinct  but undulated there on the billows  anunearthly  formless  chance like apparition of life as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again  starbuck stillgazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk  with a wild voiceexclaimed  almost rather had i seen moby dick and fought him  than tohave seen thee  thou white ghost   what was it  sir   said flask  the great live squid  which  they say  few whale ships ever beheld and returned to their ports to tell of it  but ahab said nothing  turning his boat  he sailed back to the vessel the rest as silently following whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connectedwith the sight of this object  certain it is  that a glimpse of itbeing so very unusual  that circumstance has gone far to invest it withportentousness 
so rarely is it beheld  that though one and all of themdeclare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean  yet very fewof them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true natureand form  notwithstanding  they believe it to furnish to the spermwhale his only food 
for though other species of whales find their foodabove water  and may be seen by man in the act of feeding  thespermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below thesurface  and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what precisely  that food consists 
at times  when closely pursued  he willdisgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid  someof them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length 
theyfancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clingsby them to the bed of the ocean  and that the sperm whale  unlike otherspecies  is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishoppontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid 
the manner inwhich the bishop describes it  as alternately rising and sinking  withsome other particulars he narrates  in all this the two correspond 
butmuch abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk heassigns it by some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysteriouscreature  here spoken of  it is included among the class ofcuttle fish  to which  indeed  in certain external respects it wouldseem to belong  but only as the anak of the tribe chapter 60 
the line with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described  as well asfor the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented i have here to speak of the magical  sometimes horrible whale line the line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp  slightlyvapored with tar  not impregnated with it  as in the case of ordinaryropes  for while tar  as ordinarily used  makes the hemp more pliableto the rope maker  and also renders the rope itself more convenient tothe sailor for common ship use  yet  not only would the ordinaryquantity too much stiffen the whale line for the close coiling to whichit must be subjected  but as most seamen are beginning to learn  tar ingeneral by no means adds to the rope s durability or strength  howevermuch it may give it compactness and gloss of late years the manilla rope has in the american fishery almostentirely superseded hemp as a material for whale lines  for  though notso durable as hemp  it is stronger  and far more soft and elastic  andi will add  since there is an æsthetics in all things   is much morehandsome and becoming to the boat  than hemp 
hemp is a dusky  darkfellow  a sort of indian  but manilla is as a golden haired circassianto behold the whale line is only two thirds of an inch in thickness 
at firstsight  you would not think it so strong as it really is 
by experimentits one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred andtwenty pounds  so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equalto three tons 
in length  the common sperm whale line measuressomething over two hundred fathoms 
towards the stern of the boat it isspirally coiled away in the tub  not like the worm pipe of a stillthough  but so as to form one round  cheese shaped mass of denselybedded  sheaves   or layers of concentric spiralizations  without anyhollow but the  heart   or minute vertical tube formed at the axis ofthe cheese 
as the least tangle or kink in the coiling would  inrunning out  infallibly take somebody s arm  leg  or entire body off the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub 
someharpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through ablock towards the tub  so as in the act of coiling to free it from allpossible wrinkles and twists in the english boats two tubs are used instead of one  the same linebeing continuously coiled in both tubs 
there is some advantage inthis  because these twin tubs being so small they fit more readily intothe boat  and do not strain it so much  whereas  the american tub nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth  makes arather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half inch inthickness  for the bottom of the whale boat is like critical ice  whichwill bear up a considerable distributed weight  but not very much of aconcentrated one 
when the painted canvas cover is clapped on theamerican line tub  the boat looks as if it were pulling off with aprodigious great wedding cake to present to the whales both ends of the line are exposed  the lower end terminating in aneye splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of thetub  and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything this arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts 
first in order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from aneighboring boat  in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as tothreaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to theharpoon 
in these instances  the whale of course is shifted like a mugof ale  as it were  from the one boat to the other  though the firstboat always hovers at hand to assist its consort 
second  thisarrangement is indispensable for common safety s sake  for were thelower end of the line in any way attached to the boat  and were thewhale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single  smokingminute as he sometimes does  he would not stop there  for the doomedboat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity ofthe sea  and in that case no town crier would ever find her again before lowering the boat for the chase  the upper end of the line istaken aft from the tub  and passing round the loggerhead there  isagain carried forward the entire length of the boat  resting crosswiseupon the loom or handle of every man s oar  so that it jogs against hiswrist in rowing  and also passing between the men  as they alternatelysit at the opposite gunwales  to the leaded chocks or grooves in theextreme pointed prow of the boat  where a wooden pin or skewer the sizeof a common quill  prevents it from slipping out 
from the chocks ithangs in a slight festoon over the bows  and is then passed inside theboat again  and some ten or twenty fathoms  called box line  beingcoiled upon the box in the bows  it continues its way to the gunwalestill a little further aft  and is then attached to the short warp therope which is immediately connected with the harpoon  but previous tothat connexion  the short warp goes through sundry mystifications tootedious to detail thus the whale line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction 
all theoarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions  so that to the timideye of the landsman  they seem as indian jugglers  with the deadliestsnakes sportively festooning their limbs 
nor can any son of mortalwoman  for the first time  seat himself amid those hempen intricacies and while straining his utmost at the oar  bethink him that at anyunknown instant the harpoon may be darted  and all these horriblecontortions be put in play like ringed lightnings  he cannot be thuscircumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bonesto quiver in him like a shaken jelly 
yet habit strange thing 
whatcannot habit accomplish  gayer sallies  more merry mirth  better jokes and brighter repartees  you never heard over your mahogany  than youwill hear over the half inch white cedar of the whale boat  when thushung in hangman s nooses  and  like the six burghers of calais beforeking edward  the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws ofdeath  with a halter around every neck  as you may say perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for thoserepeated whaling disasters some few of which are casually chronicled ofthis man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line  and lost for  when the line is darting out  to be seated then in the boat  islike being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of asteam engine in full play  when every flying beam  and shaft  andwheel  is grazing you 
it is worse  for you cannot sit motionless inthe heart of these perils  because the boat is rocking like a cradle and you are pitched one way and the other  without the slightestwarning  and only by a certain self adjusting buoyancy andsimultaneousness of volition and action  can you escape being made amazeppa of  and run away with where the all seeing sun himself couldnever pierce you out again  as the profound calm which only apparently precedes andprophesies of the storm  is perhaps more awful than the storm itself for  indeed  the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm  andcontains it in itself  as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatalpowder  and the ball  and the explosion  so the graceful repose of theline  as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being broughtinto actual play this is a thing which carries more of true terror thanany other aspect of this dangerous affair 
but why say more 
all menlive enveloped in whale lines 
all are born with halters round theirnecks  but it is only when caught in the swift  sudden turn of death that mortals realize the silent  subtle  ever present perils of life and if you be a philosopher  though seated in the whale boat  you wouldnot at heart feel one whit more of terror  than though seated beforeyour evening fire with a poker  and not a harpoon  by your side chapter 61 
stubb kills a whale if to starbuck the apparition of the squid was a thing of portents  toqueequeg it was quite a different object  when you see him  quid   said the savage  honing his harpoon in thebow of his hoisted boat   then you quick see him  parm whale  the next day was exceedingly still and sultry  and with nothing specialto engage them  the pequod s crew could hardly resist the spell ofsleep induced by such a vacant sea 
for this part of the indian oceanthrough which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a livelyground  that is  it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises  dolphins flying fish  and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters  thanthose off the rio de la plata  or the in shore ground off peru it was my turn to stand at the foremast head  and with my shouldersleaning against the slackened royal shrouds  to and fro i idly swayedin what seemed an enchanted air 
no resolution could withstand it  inthat dreamy mood losing all consciousness  at last my soul went out ofmy body  though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn ere forgetfulness altogether came over me  i had noticed that theseamen at the main and mizzen mast heads were already drowsy 
so thatat last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars  and for everyswing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumberinghelmsman 
the waves  too  nodded their indolent crests  and across thewide trance of the sea  east nodded to west  and the sun over all suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes  like vices myhands grasped the shrouds  some invisible  gracious agency preservedme  with a shock i came back to life 
and lo 
close under our lee  notforty fathoms off  a gigantic sperm whale lay rolling in the water likethe capsized hull of a frigate  his broad  glossy back  of an ethiopianhue  glistening in the sun s rays like a mirror 
but lazily undulatingin the trough of the sea  and ever and anon tranquilly spouting hisvapory jet  the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe ofa warm afternoon 
but that pipe  poor whale  was thy last 
as if struckby some enchanter s wand  the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it allat once started into wakefulness  and more than a score of voices fromall parts of the vessel  simultaneously with the three notes fromaloft  shouted forth the accustomed cry  as the great fish slowly andregularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air  clear away the boats 
luff   cried ahab 
and obeying his own order  hedashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes the sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale  andere the boats were down  majestically turning  he swam away to theleeward  but with such a steady tranquillity  and making so few ripplesas he swam  that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used  and no man must speakbut in whispers 
so seated like ontario indians on the gunwales of theboats  we swiftly but silently paddled along  the calm not admitting ofthe noiseless sails being set 
presently  as we thus glided in chase the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up  there go flukes   was the cry  an announcement immediately followed bystubb s producing his match and igniting his pipe  for now a respitewas granted 
after the full interval of his sounding had elapsed  thewhale rose again  and being now in advance of the smoker s boat  andmuch nearer to it than to any of the others  stubb counted upon thehonor of the capture 
it was obvious  now  that the whale had at lengthbecome aware of his pursuers 
all silence of cautiousness was thereforeno longer of use 
paddles were dropped  and oars came loudly into play and still puffing at his pipe  stubb cheered on his crew to theassault yes  a mighty change had come over the fish 
all alive to his jeopardy he was going  head out   that part obliquely projecting from the madyeast which he brewed 
  it will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance theentire interior of the sperm whale s enormous head consists 
thoughapparently the most massive  it is by far the most buoyant part abouthim 
so that with ease he elevates it in the air  and invariably doesso when going at his utmost speed 
besides  such is the breadth of theupper part of the front of his head  and such the tapering cut waterformation of the lower part  that by obliquely elevating his head  hethereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff bowed sluggishgalliot into a sharppointed new york pilot boat  start her  start her  my men 
don t hurry yourselves  take plenty oftime but start her  start her like thunder claps  that s all   criedstubb  spluttering out the smoke as he spoke 
 start her  now  give  emthe long and strong stroke  tashtego 
start her  tash  my boy starther  all  but keep cool  keep cool cucumbers is the word easy easy only start her like grim death and grinning devils  and raise theburied dead perpendicular out of their graves  boys that s all 
wa hee   screamed the gay header in reply  raising some oldwar whoop to the skies  as every oarsman in the strained boatinvoluntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading strokewhich the eager indian gave but his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild 
 kee hee kee hee   yelled daggoo  straining forwards and backwards on his seat like a pacing tiger in his cage  ka la 
koo loo   howled queequeg  as if smacking his lips over amouthful of grenadier s steak 
and thus with oars and yells the keelscut the sea 
meanwhile  stubb retaining his place in the van  stillencouraged his men to the onset  all the while puffing the smoke fromhis mouth 
like desperadoes they tugged and they strained  till thewelcome cry was heard  stand up  tashtego  give it to him   the harpoonwas hurled 
 stern all   the oarsmen backed water  the same momentsomething went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists 
it wasthe magical line 
an instant before  stubb had swiftly caught twoadditional turns with it round the loggerhead  whence  by reason of itsincreased rapid circlings  a hempen blue smoke now jetted up andmingled with the steady fumes from his pipe 
as the line passed roundand round the loggerhead  so also  just before reaching that point  itblisteringly passed through and through both of stubb s hands  fromwhich the hand cloths  or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn atthese times  had accidentally dropped 
it was like holding an enemy ssharp two edged sword by the blade  and that enemy all the timestriving to wrest it out of your clutch  wet the line 
wet the line   cried stubb to the tub oarsman  himseated by the tub  who  snatching off his hat  dashed sea water intoit 
  more turns were taken  so that the line began holding its place the boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins stubb and tashtego here changed places stem for stern a staggeringbusiness truly in that rocking commotion 
 partly to show the indispensableness of this act  it may here bestated  that  in the old dutch fishery  a mop was used to dash therunning line with water  in many other ships  a wooden piggin  orbailer  is set apart for that purpose 
your hat  however  is the mostconvenient from the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper partof the boat  and from its now being more tight than a harpstring  youwould have thought the craft had two keels one cleaving the water  theother the air as the boat churned on through both opposing elements atonce 
a continual cascade played at the bows  a ceaseless whirling eddyin her wake  and  at the slightest motion from within  even but of alittle finger  the vibrating  cracking craft canted over her spasmodicgunwale into the sea 
thus they rushed  each man with might and mainclinging to his seat  to prevent being tossed to the foam  and the tallform of tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double  in orderto bring down his centre of gravity 
whole atlantics and pacificsseemed passed as they shot on their way  till at length the whalesomewhat slackened his flight  haul in haul in   cried stubb to the bowsman 
and  facing roundtowards the whale  all hands began pulling the boat up to him  whileyet the boat was being towed on 
soon ranging up by his flank  stubb firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat  darted dart after dartinto the flying fish  at the word of command  the boat alternatelysterning out of the way of the whale s horrible wallow  and thenranging up for another fling the red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks downa hill 
his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood  whichbubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake 
the slanting sunplaying upon this crimson pond in the sea  sent back its reflectioninto every face  so that they all glowed to each other like red men and all the while  jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shotfrom the spiracle of the whale  and vehement puff after puff from themouth of the excited headsman  as at every dart  hauling in upon hiscrooked lance  by the line attached to it   stubb straightened it againand again  by a few rapid blows against the gunwale  then again andagain sent it into the whale  pull up pull up   he now cried to the bowsman  as the waning whalerelaxed in his wrath 
 pull up  close to   and the boat ranged alongthe fish s flank 
when reaching far over the bow  stubb slowly churnedhis long sharp lance into the fish  and kept it there  carefullychurning and churning  as if cautiously seeking to feel after some goldwatch that the whale might have swallowed  and which he was fearful ofbreaking ere he could hook it out 
but that gold watch he sought wasthe innermost life of the fish 
and now it is struck  for  startingfrom his trance into that unspeakable thing called his  flurry   themonster horribly wallowed in his blood  overwrapped himself inimpenetrable  mad  boiling spray  so that the imperilled craft instantly dropping astern  had much ado blindly to struggle out fromthat phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day and now abating in his flurry  the whale once more rolled out intoview  surging from side to side  spasmodically dilating and contractinghis spout hole  with sharp  cracking  agonized respirations 
at last gush after gush of clotted red gore  as if it had been the purple leesof red wine  shot into the frighted air  and falling back again  randripping down his motionless flanks into the sea 
his heart had burst  he s dead  mr  stubb   said daggoo  yes  both pipes smoked out   and withdrawing his own from his mouth stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water  and  for a moment  stoodthoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made chapter 62 
the dart a word concerning an incident in the last chapter according to the invariable usage of the fishery  the whale boat pushesoff from the ship  with the headsman or whale killer as temporarysteersman  and the harpooneer or whale fastener pulling the foremostoar  the one known as the harpooneer oar 
now it needs a strong nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish  for often  in whatis called a long dart  the heavy implement has to be flung to thedistance of twenty or thirty feet 
but however prolonged and exhaustingthe chase  the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to theuttermost  indeed  he is expected to set an example of superhumanactivity to the rest  not only by incredible rowing  but by repeatedloud and intrepid exclamations  and what it is to keep shouting at thetop of one s compass  while all the other muscles are strained and halfstarted what that is none know but those who have tried it 
for one  icannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the sametime 
in this straining  bawling state  then  with his back to thefish  all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the excitingcry  stand up  and give it to him   he now has to drop and secure hisoar  turn round on his centre half way  seize his harpoon from thecrotch  and with what little strength may remain  he essays to pitch itsomehow into the whale 
no wonder  taking the whole fleet of whalemenin a body  that out of fifty fair chances for a dart  not five aresuccessful  no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursedand disrated  no wonder that some of them actually burst theirblood vessels in the boat  no wonder that some sperm whalemen areabsent four years with four barrels  no wonder that to many shipowners  whaling is but a losing concern  for it is the harpooneer thatmakes the voyage  and if you take the breath out of his body how canyou expect to find it there when most wanted again  if the dart be successful  then at the second critical instant that is  when the whale starts to run  the boatheader and harpooneerlikewise start to running fore and aft  to the imminent jeopardy ofthemselves and every one else 
it is then they change places  and theheadsman  the chief officer of the little craft  takes his properstation in the bows of the boat now  i care not who maintains the contrary  but all this is bothfoolish and unnecessary 
the headsman should stay in the bows fromfirst to last  he should both dart the harpoon and the lance  and norowing whatever should be expected of him  except under circumstancesobvious to any fisherman 
i know that this would sometimes involve aslight loss of speed in the chase  but long experience in variouswhalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vastmajority of failures in the fishery  it has not by any means been somuch the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of theharpooneer that has caused them to insure the greatest efficiency in the dart  the harpooneers of thisworld must start to their feet from out of idleness  and not from outof toil chapter 63 
the crotch out of the trunk  the branches grow  out of them  the twigs 
so  inproductive subjects  grow the chapters the crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention it is a notched stick of a peculiar form  some two feet in length which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near thebow  for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity ofthe harpoon  whose other naked  barbed end slopingly projects from theprow 
thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler  whosnatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings hisrifle from the wall 
it is customary to have two harpoons reposing inthe crotch  respectively called the first and second irons but these two harpoons  each by its own cord  are both connected withthe line  the object being this  to dart them both  if possible  oneinstantly after the other into the same whale  so that if  in thecoming drag  one should draw out  the other may still retain a hold 
itis a doubling of the chances 
but it very often happens that owing tothe instantaneous  violent  convulsive running of the whale uponreceiving the first iron  it becomes impossible for the harpooneer however lightning like in his movements  to pitch the second iron intohim 
nevertheless  as the second iron is already connected with theline  and the line is running  hence that weapon must  at all events be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat  somehow and somewhere  elsethe most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands 
tumbled into thewater  it accordingly is in such cases  the spare coils of box line mentioned in a preceding chapter  making this feat  in most instances prudently practicable 
but this critical act is not always unattendedwith the saddest and most fatal casualties furthermore  you must know that when the second iron is thrownoverboard  it thenceforth becomes a dangling  sharp edged terror skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale  entangling the lines or cutting them  and making a prodigious sensation in all directions nor  in general  is it possible to secure it again until the whale isfairly captured and a corpse consider  now  how it must be in the case of four boats all engagingone unusually strong  active  and knowing whale  when owing to thesequalities in him  as well as to the thousand concurring accidents ofsuch an audacious enterprise  eight or ten loose second irons may besimultaneously dangling about him 
for  of course  each boat issupplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the firstone be ineffectually darted without recovery 
all these particulars arefaithfully narrated here  as they will not fail to elucidate severalmost important  however intricate passages  in scenes hereafter to bepainted chapter 64 
stubb s supper stubb s whale had been killed some distance from the ship 
it was acalm  so  forming a tandem of three boats  we commenced the slowbusiness of towing the trophy to the pequod 
and now  as we eighteenmen with our thirty six arms  and one hundred and eighty thumbs andfingers  slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert  sluggish corpsein the sea  and it seemed hardly to budge at all  except at longintervals  good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness ofthe mass we moved 
for  upon the great canal of hang ho  or whateverthey call it  in china  four or five laborers on the foot path willdraw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour  but thisgrand argosy we towed heavily forged along  as if laden with pig leadin bulk darkness came on  but three lights up and down in the pequod smain rigging dimly guided our way  till drawing nearer we saw ahabdropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks 
vacantlyeyeing the heaving whale for a moment  he issued the usual orders forsecuring it for the night  and then handing his lantern to a seaman went his way into the cabin  and did not come forward again untilmorning though  in overseeing the pursuit of this whale  captain ahab hadevinced his customary activity  to call it so  yet now that thecreature was dead  some vague dissatisfaction  or impatience  ordespair  seemed working in him  as if the sight of that dead bodyreminded him that moby dick was yet to be slain  and though a thousandother whales were brought to his ship  all that would not one jotadvance his grand  monomaniac object 
very soon you would have thoughtfrom the sound on the pequod s decks  that all hands were preparing tocast anchor in the deep  for heavy chains are being dragged along thedeck  and thrust rattling out of the port holes 
but by those clankinglinks  the vast corpse itself  not the ship  is to be moored 
tied bythe head to the stern  and by the tail to the bows  the whale now lieswith its black hull close to the vessel s and seen through the darknessof the night  which obscured the spars and rigging aloft  the two shipand whale  seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks  whereof onereclines while the other remains standing 
  a little item may as well be related here 
the strongest and mostreliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside is by the flukes or tail  and as from its greater density that part isrelatively heavier than any other  excepting the side fins   itsflexibility even in death  causes it to sink low beneath the surface so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat  in order toput the chain round it 
but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome  asmall  strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end and a weight in its middle  while the other end is secured to the ship by adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other sideof the mass  so that now having girdled the whale  the chain is readilymade to follow suit  and being slipped along the body  is at lastlocked fast round the smallest part of the tail  at the point ofjunction with its broad flukes or lobes if moody ahab was now all quiescence  at least so far as could be knownon deck  stubb  his second mate  flushed with conquest  betrayed anunusual but still good natured excitement 
such an unwonted bustle washe in that the staid starbuck  his official superior  quietly resignedto him for the time the sole management of affairs 
one small  helpingcause of all this liveliness in stubb  was soon made strangelymanifest 
stubb was a high liver  he was somewhat intemperately fond ofthe whale as a flavorish thing to his palate  a steak  a steak  ere i sleep 
you  daggoo 
overboard you go  and cutme one from his small  here be it known  that though these wild fishermen do not  as a generalthing  and according to the great military maxim  make the enemy defraythe current expenses of the war  at least before realizing the proceedsof the voyage   yet now and then you find some of these nantucketerswho have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whaledesignated by stubb  comprising the tapering extremity of the body about midnight that steak was cut and cooked  and lighted by twolanterns of sperm oil  stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supperat the capstan head  as if that capstan were a sideboard 
nor was stubbthe only banqueter on whale s flesh that night 
mingling theirmumblings with his own mastications  thousands on thousands of sharks swarming round the dead leviathan  smackingly feasted on its fatness the few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharpslapping of their tails against the hull  within a few inches of thesleepers  hearts 
peering over the side you could just see them  asbefore you heard them  wallowing in the sullen  black waters  andturning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces ofthe whale of the bigness of a human head 
this particular feat of theshark seems all but miraculous 
how at such an apparently unassailablesurface  they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls  remainsa part of the universal problem of all things 
the mark they thus leaveon the whale  may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter incountersinking for a screw though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea fight  sharkswill be seen longingly gazing up to the ship s decks  like hungry dogsround a table where red meat is being carved  ready to bolt down everykilled man that is tossed to them  and though  while the valiantbutchers over the deck table are thus cannibally carving each other slive meat with carving knives all gilded and tasselled  the sharks also  with their jewel hilted mouths  are quarrelsomely carving awayunder the table at the dead meat  and though  were you to turn thewhole affair upside down  it would still be pretty much the same thing that is to say  a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave shipscrossing the atlantic  systematically trotting alongside  to be handyin case a parcel is to be carried anywhere  or a dead slave to bedecently buried  and though one or two other like instances might beset down  touching the set terms  places  and occasions  when sharks domost socially congregate  and most hilariously feast  yet is there noconceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countlessnumbers  and in gayer or more jovial spirits  than around a dead spermwhale  moored by night to a whaleship at sea 
if you have never seenthat sight  then suspend your decision about the propriety ofdevil worship  and the expediency of conciliating the devil but  as yet  stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that wasgoing on so nigh him  no more than the sharks heeded the smacking ofhis own epicurean lips  cook  cook  where s that old fleece   he cried at length  widening hislegs still further  as if to form a more secure base for his supper and  at the same time darting his fork into the dish  as if stabbingwith his lance   cook  you cook  sail this way  cook  the old black  not in any very high glee at having been previouslyroused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour  cameshambling along from his galley  for  like many old blacks  there wassomething the matter with his knee pans  which he did not keep wellscoured like his other pans  this old fleece  as they called him  cameshuffling and limping along  assisting his step with his tongs  which after a clumsy fashion  were made of straightened iron hoops  this oldebony floundered along  and in obedience to the word of command  cameto a dead stop on the opposite side of stubb s sideboard  when  withboth hands folded before him  and resting on his two legged cane  hebowed his arched back still further over  at the same time sidewaysinclining his head  so as to bring his best ear into play  cook   said stubb  rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to hismouth   don t you think this steak is rather overdone

the whale as a dish that mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp  and like stubb  eat him by his own light  as you may say  this seems sooutlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history andphilosophy of it it is upon record  that three centuries ago the tongue of the rightwhale was esteemed a great delicacy in france  and commanded largeprices there 
also  that in henry viiith s time  a certain cook of thecourt obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to beeaten with barbacued porpoises  which  you remember  are a species ofwhale 
porpoises  indeed  are to this day considered fine eating 
themeat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls  and beingwell seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle balls or veal balls the old monks of dunfermline were very fond of them 
they had a greatporpoise grant from the crown the fact is  that among his hunters at least  the whale would by allhands be considered a noble dish  were there not so much of him  butwhen you come to sit down before a meat pie nearly one hundred feetlong  it takes away your appetite 
only the most unprejudiced of menlike stubb  nowadays partake of cooked whales  but the esquimaux arenot so fastidious 
we all know how they live upon whales  and have rareold vintages of prime old train oil 
zogranda  one of their most famousdoctors  recommends strips of blubber for infants  as being exceedinglyjuicy and nourishing 
and this reminds me that certain englishmen  wholong ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vessel thatthese men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps ofwhales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber 
amongthe dutch whalemen these scraps are called  fritters   which  indeed they greatly resemble  being brown and crisp  and smelling somethinglike old amsterdam housewives  dough nuts or oly cooks  when fresh they have such an eatable look that the most self denying stranger canhardly keep his hands off but what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish  is hisexceeding richness 
he is the great prize ox of the sea  too fat to bedelicately good 
look at his hump  which would be as fine eating as thebuffalo s  which is esteemed a rare dish   were it not such a solidpyramid of fat 
but the spermaceti itself  how bland and creamy thatis  like the transparent  half jellied  white meat of a cocoanut in thethird month of its growth  yet far too rich to supply a substitute forbutter 
nevertheless  many whalemen have a method of absorbing it intosome other substance  and then partaking of it 
in the long try watchesof the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip theirship biscuit into the huge oil pots and let them fry there awhile 
manya good supper have i thus made in the case of a small sperm whale the brains are accounted a finedish 
the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe  and the twoplump  whitish lobes being withdrawn  precisely resembling two largepuddings   they are then mixed with flour  and cooked into a mostdelectable mess  in flavor somewhat resembling calves  head  which isquite a dish among some epicures  and every one knows that some youngbucks among the epicures  by continually dining upon calves  brains  byand by get to have a little brains of their own  so as to be able totell a calf s head from their own heads  which  indeed  requiresuncommon discrimination 
and that is the reason why a young buck withan intelligent looking calf s head before him  is somehow one of thesaddest sights you can see 
the head looks a sort of reproachfully athim  with an  et tu brute   expression it is not  perhaps  entirely because the whale is so excessivelyunctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him withabhorrence  that appears to result  in some way  from the considerationbefore mentioned  i e  that a man should eat a newly murdered thingof the sea  and eat it too by its own light 
but no doubt the first manthat ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer  perhaps he washung  and if he had been put on his trial by oxen  he certainly wouldhave been  and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does

it is only within the last monthor two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing butsteel pens chapter 66 
the shark massacre when in the southern fishery  a captured sperm whale  after long andweary toil  is brought alongside late at night  it is not  as a generalthing at least  customary to proceed at once to the business of cuttinghim in 
for that business is an exceedingly laborious one  is not verysoon completed  and requires all hands to set about it 
therefore  thecommon usage is to take in all sail  lash the helm a lee  and then sendevery one below to his hammock till daylight  with the reservationthat  until that time  anchor watches shall be kept  that is  two andtwo for an hour  each couple  the crew in rotation shall mount the deckto see that all goes well but sometimes  especially upon the line in the pacific  this plan willnot answer at all  because such incalculable hosts of sharks gatherround the moored carcase  that were he left so for six hours  say  on astretch  little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning 
inmost other parts of the ocean  however  where these fish do not solargely abound  their wondrous voracity can be at times considerablydiminished  by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling spades  aprocedure notwithstanding  which  in some instances  only seems totickle them into still greater activity 
but it was not thus in thepresent case with the pequod s sharks  though  to be sure  any manunaccustomed to such sights  to have looked over her side that night would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese  andthose sharks the maggots in it nevertheless  upon stubb setting the anchor watch after his supper wasconcluded  and when  accordingly  queequeg and a forecastle seaman cameon deck  no small excitement was created among the sharks  forimmediately suspending the cutting stages over the side  and loweringthree lanterns  so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbidsea  these two mariners  darting their long whaling spades  kept up anincessant murdering of the sharks   by striking the keen steel deepinto their skulls  seemingly their only vital part 
but in the foamyconfusion of their mixed and struggling hosts  the marksmen could notalways hit their mark  and this brought about new revelations of theincredible ferocity of the foe 
they viciously snapped  not only ateach other s disembowelments  but like flexible bows  bent round  andbit their own  till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over againby the same mouth  to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound 
nor wasthis all 
it was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of thesecreatures 
a sort of generic or pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk intheir very joints and bones  after what might be called the individuallife had departed 
killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin one of these sharks almost took poor queequeg s hand off  when he triedto shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw 
 the whaling spade used for cutting in is made of the very best steel is about the bigness of a man s spread hand  and in general shape corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named  only itssides are perfectly flat  and its upper end considerably narrower thanthe lower 
this weapon is always kept as sharp as possible  and whenbeing used is occasionally honed  just like a razor 
in its socket  astiff pole  from twenty to thirty feet long  is inserted for a handle  queequeg no care what god made him shark   said the savage agonizingly lifting his hand up and down   wedder fejee god ornantucket god  but de god wat made shark must be one dam ingin  chapter 67 
cutting in it was a saturday night  and such a sabbath as followed 
ex officioprofessors of sabbath breaking are all whalemen 
the ivory pequod wasturned into what seemed a shamble  every sailor a butcher 
you wouldhave thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods in the first place  the enormous cutting tackles  among other ponderousthings comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green  andwhich no single man can possibly lift this vast bunch of grapes wasswayed up to the main top and firmly lashed to the lower mast head  thestrongest point anywhere above a ship s deck 
the end of thehawser like rope winding through these intricacies  was then conductedto the windlass  and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung overthe whale  to this block the great blubber hook  weighing some onehundred pounds  was attached 
and now suspended in stages over theside  starbuck and stubb  the mates  armed with their long spades began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook justabove the nearest of the two side fins 
this done  a broad semicircular line is cut round the hole  the hook is inserted  and themain body of the crew striking up a wild chorus  now commence heavingin one dense crowd at the windlass 
when instantly  the entire shipcareens over on her side  every bolt in her starts like the nail headsof an old house in frosty weather  she trembles  quivers  and nods herfrighted mast heads to the sky 
more and more she leans over to thewhale  while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by ahelping heave from the billows  till at last  a swift  startling snapis heard  with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards fromthe whale  and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after itthe disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber 
now asthe blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimesstripped by spiralizing it 
for the strain constantly kept up by thewindlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in thewater  and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along theline called the  scarf   simultaneously cut by the spades of starbuckand stubb  the mates  and just as fast as it is thus peeled off  andindeed by that very act itself  it is all the time being hoisted higherand higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main top  the men at thewindlass then cease heaving  and for a moment or two the prodigiousblood dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky  andevery one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings  elseit may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard one of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long  keen weaponcalled a boarding sword  and watching his chance he dexterously slicesout a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass 
intothis hole  the end of the second alternating great tackle is thenhooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber  in order to prepare forwhat follows 
whereupon  this accomplished swordsman  warning all handsto stand off  once more makes a scientific dash at the mass  and with afew sidelong  desperate  lunging slicings  severs it completely intwain  so that while the short lower part is still fast  the long upperstrip  called a blanket piece  swings clear  and is all ready forlowering 
the heavers forward now resume their song  and while the onetackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale  the otheris slowly slackened away  and down goes the first strip through themain hatchway right beneath  into an unfurnished parlor called theblubber room 
into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keepcoiling away the long blanket piece as if it were a great live mass ofplaited serpents 
and thus the work proceeds  the two tackles hoistingand lowering simultaneously  both whale and windlass heaving  theheavers singing  the blubber room gentlemen coiling  the matesscarfing  the ship straining  and all hands swearing occasionally  byway of assuaging the general friction chapter 68 
the blanket i have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject  the skinof the whale 
i have had controversies about it with experiencedwhalemen afloat  and learned naturalists ashore 
my original opinionremains unchanged  but it is only an opinion the question is  what and where is the skin of the whale 
already youknow what his blubber is 
that blubber is something of the consistenceof firm  close grained beef  but tougher  more elastic and compact  andranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness now  however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of anycreature s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness  yetin point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from thewhale s body but that same blubber  and the outermost enveloping layerof any animal  if reasonably dense  what can that be but the skin true  from the unmarred dead body of the whale  you may scrape off withyour hand an infinitely thin  transparent substance  somewhatresembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass  only it is almost asflexible and soft as satin  that is  previous to being dried  when itnot only contracts and thickens  but becomes rather hard and brittle 
ihave several such dried bits  which i use for marks in my whale books it is transparent  as i said before  and being laid upon the printedpage  i have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted amagnifying influence 
at any rate  it is pleasant to read about whalesthrough their own spectacles  as you may say 
but what i am driving athere is this 
that same infinitely thin  isinglass substance  which  iadmit  invests the entire body of the whale  is not so much to beregarded as the skin of the creature  as the skin of the skin  so tospeak  for it were simply ridiculous to say  that the proper skin ofthe tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of anew born child 
but no more of this assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale  then  when this skin as in the case of a very large sperm whale  will yield the bulk of onehundred barrels of oil  and  when it is considered that  in quantity or rather weight  that oil  in its expressed state  is only threefourths  and not the entire substance of the coat  some idea may hencebe had of the enormousness of that animated mass  a mere part of whosemere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that 
reckoning tenbarrels to the ton  you have ten tons for the net weight of only threequarters of the stuff of the whale s skin in life  the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least amongthe many marvels he presents 
almost invariably it is all overobliquely crossed and re crossed with numberless straight marks inthick array  something like those in the finest italian lineengravings 
but these marks do not seem to be impressed upon theisinglass substance above mentioned  but seem to be seen through it  asif they were engraved upon the body itself 
nor is this all 
in someinstances  to the quick  observant eye  those linear marks  as in averitable engraving  but afford the ground for far other delineations these are hieroglyphical  that is  if you call those mysterious cypherson the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics  then that is the proper word touse in the present connexion 
by my retentive memory of thehieroglyphics upon one sperm whale in particular  i was much struckwith a plate representing the old indian characters chiselled on thefamous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the upper mississippi like those mystic rocks  too  the mystic marked whale remainsundecipherable 
this allusion to the indian rocks reminds me of anotherthing 
besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the spermwhale presents  he not seldom displays the back  and more especiallyhis flanks  effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance  byreason of numerous rude scratches  altogether of an irregular  randomaspect 
i should say that those new england rocks on the sea coast which agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contactwith vast floating icebergs i should say  that those rocks must not alittle resemble the sperm whale in this particular 
it also seems to methat such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contactwith other whales  for i have most remarked them in the large full grown bulls of the species a word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of thewhale 
it has already been said  that it is stript from him in longpieces  called blanket pieces 
like most sea terms  this one is veryhappy and significant 
for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubberas in a real blanket or counterpane  or  still better  an indian ponchoslipt over his head  and skirting his extremity 
it is by reason ofthis cosy blanketing of his body  that the whale is enabled to keephimself comfortable in all weathers  in all seas  times  and tides what would become of a greenland whale  say  in those shuddering  icyseas of the north  if unsupplied with his cosy surtout 
true  otherfish are found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean waters  butthese  be it observed  are your cold blooded  lungless fish  whose verybellies are refrigerators  creatures  that warm themselves under thelee of an iceberg  as a traveller in winter would bask before an innfire  whereas  like man  the whale has lungs and warm blood 
freeze hisblood  and he dies 
how wonderful is it then except afterexplanation that this great monster  to whom corporeal warmth is asindispensable as it is to man  how wonderful that he should be found athome  immersed to his lips for life in those arctic waters 
where  whenseamen fall overboard  they are sometimes found  months afterwards perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice  as a fly isfound glued in amber 
but more surprising is it to know  as has beenproved by experiment  that the blood of a polar whale is warmer thanthat of a borneo negro in summer it does seem to me  that herein we see the rare virtue of a strongindividual vitality  and the rare virtue of thick walls  and the rarevirtue of interior spaciousness 
oh  man 
admire and model thyselfafter the whale 
do thou  too  remain warm among ice 
do thou  too live in this world without being of it 
be cool at the equator  keepthy blood fluid at the pole 
like the great dome of st  peter s  andlike the great whale  retain  o man 
in all seasons a temperature ofthine own but how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things 
of erections how few are domed like st  peter s 
of creatures  how few vast as thewhale chapter 69 
the funeral  haul in the chains 
let the carcase go astern  the vast tackles have now done their duty 
the peeled white body of thebeheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre  though changed in hue it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk 
it is still colossal slowly it floats more and more away  the water round it torn andsplashed by the insatiate sharks  and the air above vexed withrapacious flights of screaming fowls  whose beaks are like so manyinsulting poniards in the whale 
the vast white headless phantom floatsfurther and further from the ship  and every rod that it so floats what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls  augment themurderous din 
for hours and hours from the almost stationary ship thathideous sight is seen 
beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky  uponthe fair face of the pleasant sea  wafted by the joyous breezes  thatgreat mass of death floats on and on  till lost in infiniteperspectives there s a most doleful and most mocking funeral 
the sea vultures allin pious mourning  the air sharks all punctiliously in black orspeckled 
in life but few of them would have helped the whale  i ween if peradventure he had needed it  but upon the banquet of his funeralthey most piously do pounce 
oh  horrible vultureism of earth 
fromwhich not the mightiest whale is free nor is this the end 
desecrated as the body is  a vengeful ghostsurvives and hovers over it to scare 
espied by some timid man of waror blundering discovery vessel from afar  when the distance obscuringthe swarming fowls  nevertheless still shows the white mass floating inthe sun  and the white spray heaving high against it  straightway thewhale s unharming corpse  with trembling fingers is set down in thelog shoals  rocks  and breakers hereabouts  beware  and for yearsafterwards  perhaps  ships shun the place  leaping over it as sillysheep leap over a vacuum  because their leader originally leaped therewhen a stick was held 
there s your law of precedents  there s yourutility of traditions  there s the story of your obstinate survival ofold beliefs never bottomed on the earth  and now not even hovering inthe air 
there s orthodoxy thus  while in life the great whale s body may have been a real terrorto his foes  in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to aworld are you a believer in ghosts  my friend 
there are other ghosts thanthe cock lane one  and far deeper men than doctor johnson who believein them chapter 70 
the sphynx it should not have been omitted that previous to completely strippingthe body of the leviathan  he was beheaded 
now  the beheading of thesperm whale is a scientific anatomical feat  upon which experiencedwhale surgeons very much pride themselves  and not without reason consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck on the contrary  where his head and body seem to join  there  in thatvery place  is the thickest part of him 
remember  also  that thesurgeon must operate from above  some eight or ten feet interveningbetween him and his subject  and that subject almost hidden in adiscoloured  rolling  and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea 
bearin mind  too  that under these untoward circumstances he has to cutmany feet deep in the flesh  and in that subterraneous manner  withoutso much as getting one single peep into the ever contracting gash thusmade  he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent  interdicted parts and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertioninto the skull 
do you not marvel  then  at stubb s boast  that hedemanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale when first severed  the head is dropped astern and held there by acable till the body is stripped 
that done  if it belong to a smallwhale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of 
but  with afull grown leviathan this is impossible  for the sperm whale s headembraces nearly one third of his entire bulk  and completely to suspendsuch a burden as that  even by the immense tackles of a whaler  thiswere as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a dutch barn in jewellers scales the pequod s whale being decapitated and the body stripped  the headwas hoisted against the ship s side about half way out of the sea  sothat it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element 
andthere with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it  by reason ofthe enormous downward drag from the lower mast head  and every yard armon that side projecting like a crane over the waves  there  thatblood dripping head hung to the pequod s waist like the giantholofernes s from the girdle of judith when this last task was accomplished it was noon  and the seamen wentbelow to their dinner 
silence reigned over the before tumultuous butnow deserted deck

taking a few turns on the quarter deck  he paused togaze over the side  then slowly getting into the main chains he tookstubb s long spade still remaining there after the whale sdecapitation and striking it into the lower part of the half suspendedmass  placed its other end crutch wise under one arm  and so stoodleaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head it was a black and hooded head  and hanging there in the midst of sointense a calm  it seemed the sphynx s in the desert

the jeroboam s story hand in hand  ship and breeze blew on  but the breeze came faster thanthe ship  and soon the pequod began to rock by and by  through the glass the stranger s boats and manned mast headsproved her a whale ship 
but as she was so far to windward  andshooting by  apparently making a passage to some other ground  thepequod could not hope to reach her 
so the signal was set to see whatresponse would be made here be it said  that like the vessels of military marines  the shipsof the american whale fleet have each a private signal  all whichsignals being collected in a book with the names of the respectivevessels attached  every captain is provided with it 
thereby  the whalecommanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean  even atconsiderable distances and with no small facility the pequod s signal was at last responded to by the stranger s settingher own  which proved the ship to be the jeroboam of nantucket squaring her yards  she bore down  ranged abeam under the pequod s lee and lowered a boat  it soon drew nigh  but  as the side ladder wasbeing rigged by starbuck s order to accommodate the visiting captain the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat s stern in tokenof that proceeding being entirely unnecessary 
it turned out that thejeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board  and that mayhew  hercaptain  was fearful of infecting the pequod s company 
for  thoughhimself and boat s crew remained untainted  and though his ship washalf a rifle shot off  and an incorruptible sea and air rolling andflowing between  yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantineof the land  he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact withthe pequod but this did by no means prevent all communications 
preserving aninterval of some few yards between itself and the ship  the jeroboam sboat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel tothe pequod  as she heavily forged through the sea  for by this time itblew very fresh   with her main topsail aback  though  indeed  at timesby the sudden onset of a large rolling wave  the boat would be pushedsome way ahead  but would be soon skilfully brought to her properbearings again 
subject to this  and other the like interruptions nowand then  a conversation was sustained between the two parties  but atintervals not without still another interruption of a very differentsort pulling an oar in the jeroboam s boat  was a man of a singularappearance  even in that wild whaling life where individualnotabilities make up all totalities 
he was a small  short  youngishman  sprinkled all over his face with freckles  and wearing redundantyellow hair 
a long skirted  cabalistically cut coat of a faded walnuttinge enveloped him  the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up onhis wrists 
a deep  settled  fanatic delirium was in his eyes so soon as this figure had been first descried  stubb hadexclaimed  that s he 
that s he  the long togged scaramouch thetown ho s company told us of   stubb here alluded to a strange storytold of the jeroboam  and a certain man among her crew  some timeprevious when the pequod spoke the town ho 
according to this accountand what was subsequently learned  it seemed that the scaramouch inquestion had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in thejeroboam 
his story was this he had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeunashakers  where he had been a great prophet  in their cracked  secretmeetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of atrap door  announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial  which hecarried in his vest pocket  but  which  instead of containinggunpowder  was supposed to be charged with laudanum 
a strange apostolic whim having seized him  he had left neskyeuna for nantucket where  with that cunning peculiar to craziness  he assumed a steady common sense exterior  and offered himself as a green hand candidatefor the jeroboam s whaling voyage 
they engaged him  but straightwayupon the ship s getting out of sight of land  his insanity broke out ina freshet 
he announced himself as the archangel gabriel  and commandedthe captain to jump overboard 
he published his manifesto  whereby heset himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea andvicar general of all oceanica 
the unflinching earnestness with whichhe declared these things  the dark  daring play of his sleepless excited imagination  and all the preternatural terrors of realdelirium  united to invest this gabriel in the minds of the majority ofthe ignorant crew  with an atmosphere of sacredness 
moreover  theywere afraid of him 
as such a man  however  was not of much practicaluse in the ship  especially as he refused to work except when hepleased  the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him  butapprised that that individual s intention was to land him in the firstconvenient port  the archangel forthwith opened all his seals andvials devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition  incase this intention was carried out 
so strongly did he work upon hisdisciples among the crew  that at last in a body they went to thecaptain and told him if gabriel was sent from the ship  not a man ofthem would remain 
he was therefore forced to relinquish his plan 
norwould they permit gabriel to be any way maltreated  say or do what hewould  so that it came to pass that gabriel had the complete freedom ofthe ship 
the consequence of all this was  that the archangel caredlittle or nothing for the captain and mates  and since the epidemic hadbroken out  he carried a higher hand than ever  declaring that theplague  as he called it  was at his sole command  nor should it bestayed but according to his good pleasure 
the sailors  mostly poordevils  cringed  and some of them fawned before him  in obedience tohis instructions  sometimes rendering him personal homage  as to a god such things may seem incredible  but  however wondrous  they are true nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to themeasureless self deception of the fanatic himself  as his measurelesspower of deceiving and bedevilling so many others 
but it is time toreturn to the pequod  i fear not thy epidemic  man   said ahab from the bulwarks  to captainmayhew  who stood in the boat s stern   come on board  but now gabriel started to his feet  think  think of the fevers  yellow and bilious 
beware of the horribleplague   gabriel 
gabriel   cried captain mayhew   thou must either   but thatinstant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead  and its seethingsdrowned all speech  hast thou seen the white whale   demanded ahab  when the boat driftedback  think  think of thy whale boat  stoven and sunk 
beware of thehorrible tail   i tell thee again  gabriel  that   but again the boat tore ahead as ifdragged by fiends 
nothing was said for some moments  while asuccession of riotous waves rolled by  which by one of those occasionalcaprices of the seas were tumbling  not heaving it 
meantime  thehoisted sperm whale s head jogged about very violently  and gabriel wasseen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangelnature seemed to warrant when this interlude was over  captain mayhew began a dark storyconcerning moby dick  not  however  without frequent interruptions fromgabriel  whenever his name was mentioned  and the crazy sea that seemedleagued with him it seemed that the jeroboam had not long left home  when upon speakinga whale ship  her people were reliably apprised of the existence ofmoby dick  and the havoc he had made 
greedily sucking in thisintelligence  gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking thewhite whale  in case the monster should be seen  in his gibberinginsanity  pronouncing the white whale to be no less a being than theshaker god incarnated  the shakers receiving the bible 
but when  someyear or two afterwards  moby dick was fairly sighted from themast heads  macey  the chief mate  burned with ardour to encounter him and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have theopportunity  despite all the archangel s denunciations andforewarnings  macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat with them he pushed off  and  after much weary pulling  and manyperilous  unsuccessful onsets  he at last succeeded in getting one ironfast 
meantime  gabriel  ascending to the main royal mast head  wastossing one arm in frantic gestures  and hurling forth prophecies ofspeedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity 
now  whilemacey  the mate  was standing up in his boat s bow  and with all thereckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon thewhale  and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance  lo 
abroad white shadow rose from the sea  by its quick  fanning motion temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen 
nextinstant  the luckless mate  so full of furious life  was smitten bodilyinto the air  and making a long arc in his descent  fell into the seaat the distance of about fifty yards 
not a chip of the boat washarmed  nor a hair of any oarsman s head  but the mate for ever sank it is well to parenthesize here  that of the fatal accidents in thesperm whale fishery  this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any sometimes  nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated oftener the boat s bow is knocked off  or the thigh board  in which theheadsman stands  is torn from its place and accompanies the body 
butstrangest of all is the circumstance  that in more instances than one when the body has been recovered  not a single mark of violence isdiscernible  the man being stark dead the whole calamity  with the falling form of macey  was plainlydescried from the ship 
raising a piercing shriek  the vial 
the vial  gabriel called off the terror stricken crew from the further hunting ofthe whale 
this terrible event clothed the archangel with addedinfluence  because his credulous disciples believed that he hadspecifically fore announced it  instead of only making a generalprophecy  which any one might have done  and so have chanced to hit oneof many marks in the wide margin allowed 
he became a nameless terrorto the ship mayhew having concluded his narration  ahab put such questions to him that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether heintended to hunt the white whale  if opportunity should offer 
to whichahab answered  aye   straightway  then  gabriel once more started tohis feet  glaring upon the old man  and vehemently exclaimed  withdownward pointed finger  think  think of the blasphemer dead  and downthere  beware of the blasphemer s end  ahab stolidly turned aside  then said to mayhew   captain  i have justbethought me of my letter bag  there is a letter for one of thyofficers  if i mistake not 
starbuck  look over the bag  every whale ship takes out a goodly number of letters for variousships  whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans thus  most letters never reach their mark  and many are only receivedafter attaining an age of two or three years or more soon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand 
it was sorelytumbled  damp  and covered with a dull  spotted  green mould  inconsequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin 
of such aletter  death himself might well have been the post boy  can st not read it   cried ahab 
 give it me  man 
aye  aye  it s buta dim scrawl  what s this   as he was studying it out  starbuck took along cutting spade pole  and with his knife slightly split the end  toinsert the letter there  and in that way  hand it to the boat  withoutits coming any closer to the ship meantime  ahab holding the letter  muttered   mr 
har yes  mr  harry  awoman s pinny hand  the man s wife  i ll wager  aye mr 
harry macey ship jeroboam  why it s macey  and he s dead   poor fellow 
poor fellow 
and from his wife   sighed mayhew   but letme have it   nay  keep it thyself   cried gabriel to ahab   thou art soon goingthat way   curses throttle thee   yelled ahab 
 captain mayhew  stand by now toreceive it   and taking the fatal missive from starbuck s hands  hecaught it in the slit of the pole  and reached it over towards theboat 
but as he did so  the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing the boat drifted a little towards the ship s stern  so that  as if bymagic  the letter suddenly ranged along with gabriel s eager hand 
heclutched it in an instant  seized the boat knife  and impaling theletter on it  sent it thus loaded back into the ship 
it fell at ahab sfeet 
then gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with theiroars  and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from thepequod as  after this interlude  the seamen resumed their work upon the jacketof the whale  many strange things were hinted in reference to this wildaffair chapter 72 
the monkey rope in the tumultuous business of cutting in and attending to a whale there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew 
now handsare wanted here  and then again hands are wanted there 
there is nostaying in any one place  for at one and the same time everything hasto be done everywhere 
it is much the same with him who endeavors thedescription of the scene 
we must now retrace our way a little 
it wasmentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale s back  theblubber hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by thespades of the mates 
but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as thatsame hook get fixed in that hole 
it was inserted there by myparticular friend queequeg  whose duty it was  as harpooneer  todescend upon the monster s back for the special purpose referred to but in very many cases  circumstances require that the harpooneer shallremain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation isconcluded 
the whale  be it observed  lies almost entirely submerged excepting the immediate parts operated upon 
so down there  some tenfeet below the level of the deck  the poor harpooneer flounders about half on the whale and half in the water  as the vast mass revolves likea tread mill beneath him 
on the occasion in question  queequeg figuredin the highland costume a shirt and socks in which to my eyes  atleast  he appeared to uncommon advantage  and no one had a betterchance to observe him  as will presently be seen being the savage s bowsman  that is  the person who pulled the bow oarin his boat  the second one from forward   it was my cheerful duty toattend upon him while taking that hard scrabble scramble upon the deadwhale s back 
you have seen italian organ boys holding a dancing ape bya long cord 
just so  from the ship s steep side  did i hold queequegdown there in the sea  by what is technically called in the fishery amonkey rope  attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round hiswaist it was a humorously perilous business for both of us 
for  before weproceed further  it must be said that the monkey rope was fast at bothends  fast to queequeg s broad canvas belt  and fast to my narrowleather one 
so that for better or for worse  we two  for the time were wedded  and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more  then bothusage and honor demanded  that instead of cutting the cord  it shoulddrag me down in his wake 
so  then  an elongated siamese ligatureunited us 
queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother  nor could iany way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bondentailed so strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then that while earnestly watching his motions  i seemed distinctly toperceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stockcompany of two  that my free will had received a mortal wound  and thatanother s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmeriteddisaster and death 
therefore  i saw that here was a sort ofinterregnum in providence  for its even handed equity never could haveso gross an injustice 
and yet still further pondering while i jerkedhim now and then from between the whale and ship  which would threatento jam him still further pondering  i say  i saw that this situation ofmine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes  only  inmost cases  he  one way or other  has this siamese connexion with aplurality of other mortals 
if your banker breaks  you snap  if yourapothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills  you die 
true you may say that  by exceeding caution  you may possibly escape theseand the multitudinous other evil chances of life 
but handle queequeg smonkey rope heedfully as i would  sometimes he jerked it so  that icame very near sliding overboard 
nor could i possibly forget that  dowhat i would  i only had the management of one end of it 
  the monkey rope is found in all whalers  but it was only in the pequodthat the monkey and his holder were ever tied together 
thisimprovement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a manthan stubb  in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongestpossible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of hismonkey rope holder i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between thewhale and the ship where he would occasionally fall  from the incessantrolling and swaying of both 
but this was not the only jamming jeopardyhe was exposed to 
unappalled by the massacre made upon them during thenight  the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the beforepent blood which began to flow from the carcass the rabid creaturesswarmed round it like bees in a beehive and right in among those sharks was queequeg  who often pushed themaside with his floundering feet 
a thing altogether incredible were itnot that attracted by such prey as a dead whale  the otherwisemiscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man nevertheless  it may well be believed that since they have such aravenous finger in the pie  it is deemed but wise to look sharp tothem 
accordingly  besides the monkey rope  with which i now and thenjerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of whatseemed a peculiarly ferocious shark he was provided with still anotherprotection 
suspended over the side in one of the stages  tashtego anddaggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keenwhale spades  wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they couldreach 
this procedure of theirs  to be sure  was very disinterested andbenevolent of them 
they meant queequeg s best happiness  i admit  butin their hasty zeal to befriend him  and from the circumstance thatboth he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood muddledwater  those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating aleg than a tail 
but poor queequeg  i suppose  straining and gaspingthere with that great iron hook poor queequeg  i suppose  only prayedto his yojo  and gave up his life into the hands of his gods well  well  my dear comrade and twin brother  thought i  as i drew inand then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea what mattersit  after all 
are you not the precious image of each and all of us menin this whaling world 
that unsounded ocean you gasp in  is life  thosesharks  your foes  those spades  your friends  and what between sharksand spades you are in a sad pickle and peril  poor lad but courage 
there is good cheer in store for you  queequeg 
for now as with blue lips and blood shot eyes the exhausted savage at lastclimbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarilytrembling over the side  the steward advances  and with a benevolent consolatory glance hands him what 
some hot cognac 
hands him  yegods 
hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water  ginger 
do i smell ginger   suspiciously asked stubb  coming near  yes  this must be ginger   peering into the as yet untasted cup 
thenstanding as if incredulous for a while  he calmly walked towards theastonished steward slowly saying   ginger 
and will you havethe goodness to tell me  mr  dough boy  where lies the virtue ofginger 
is ginger the sort of fuel you use  dough boy  tokindle a fire in this shivering cannibal 
ginger  what the devil isginger 
firewood  lucifer matches  tinder  gunpowder  whatthe devil is ginger  i say  that you offer this cup to our poorqueequeg here   there is some sneaking temperance society movement about thisbusiness   he suddenly added  now approaching starbuck  who had justcome from forward 
 will you look at that kannakin  sir  smell of it if you please   then watching the mate s countenance  he added   thesteward  mr  starbuck  had the face to offer that calomel and jalap toqueequeg  there  this instant off the whale 
is the steward anapothecary  sir 
and may i ask whether this is the sort of bitters bywhich he blows back the life into a half drowned man   i trust not   said starbuck   it is poor stuff enough   aye  aye  steward   cried stubb   we ll teach you to drug aharpooneer  none of your apothecary s medicine here  you want to poisonus  do ye 
you have got out insurances on our lives and want to murderus all  and pocket the proceeds  do ye   it was not me   cried dough boy   it was aunt charity that brought theginger on board  and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits but only this ginger jub so she called it   ginger jub 
you gingerly rascal 
take that 
and run along with ye tothe lockers  and get something better 
i hope i do no wrong  mr starbuck 
it is the captain s orders grog for the harpooneer on awhale   enough   replied starbuck   only don t hit him again  but   oh  i never hurt when i hit  except when i hit a whale or something ofthat sort  and this fellow s a weazel 
what were you about saying sir   only this  go down with him  and get what thou wantest thyself  when stubb reappeared  he came with a dark flask in one hand  and asort of tea caddy in the other 
the first contained strong spirits  andwas handed to queequeg  the second was aunt charity s gift  and thatwas freely given to the waves chapter 73 
stubb and flask kill a right whale  and then have a talkover him it must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whale sprodigious head hanging to the pequod s side 
but we must let itcontinue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend toit 
for the present other matters press  and the best we can do now forthe head  is to pray heaven the tackles may hold now  during the past night and forenoon  the pequod had graduallydrifted into a sea  which  by its occasional patches of yellow brit gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of right whales  a species of theleviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurkinganywhere near 
and though all hands commonly disdained the capture ofthose inferior creatures  and though the pequod was not commissioned tocruise for them at all  and though she had passed numbers of them nearthe crozetts without lowering a boat  yet now that a sperm whale hadbeen brought alongside and beheaded  to the surprise of all  theannouncement was made that a right whale should be captured that day if opportunity offered nor was this long wanting 
tall spouts were seen to leeward  and twoboats  stubb s and flask s  were detached in pursuit 
pulling furtherand further away  they at last became almost invisible to the men atthe mast head 
but suddenly in the distance  they saw a great heap oftumultuous white water  and soon after news came from aloft that one orboth the boats must be fast 
an interval passed and the boats were inplain sight  in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by thetowing whale 
so close did the monster come to the hull  that at firstit seemed as if he meant it malice  but suddenly going down in amaelstrom  within three rods of the planks  he wholly disappeared fromview  as if diving under the keel 
 cut  cut   was the cry from theship to the boats  which  for one instant  seemed on the point of beingbrought with a deadly dash against the vessel s side 
but having plentyof line yet in the tubs  and the whale not sounding very rapidly  theypaid out abundance of rope  and at the same time pulled with all theirmight so as to get ahead of the ship 
for a few minutes the strugglewas intensely critical  for while they still slacked out the tightenedline in one direction  and still plied their oars in another  thecontending strain threatened to take them under 
but it was only a fewfeet advance they sought to gain 
and they stuck to it till they didgain it  when instantly  a swift tremor was felt running like lightningalong the keel  as the strained line  scraping beneath the ship suddenly rose to view under her bows  snapping and quivering  and soflinging off its drippings  that the drops fell like bits of brokenglass on the water  while the whale beyond also rose to sight  and oncemore the boats were free to fly 
but the fagged whale abated his speed and blindly altering his course  went round the stern of the shiptowing the two boats after him  so that they performed a completecircuit meantime  they hauled more and more upon their lines  till closeflanking him on both sides  stubb answered flask with lance for lance and thus round and round the pequod the battle went  while themultitudes of sharks that had before swum round the sperm whale s body rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled  thirstily drinking at everynew gash  as the eager israelites did at the new bursting fountainsthat poured from the smitten rock at last his spout grew thick  and with a frightful roll and vomit  heturned upon his back a corpse while the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing  someconversation ensued between them  i wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard   saidstubb  not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with soignoble a leviathan  wants with it   said flask  coiling some spare line in the boat s bow  did you never hear that the ship which but once has a sperm whale shead hoisted on her starboard side  and at the same time a rightwhale s on the larboard  did you never hear  stubb  that that ship cannever afterwards capsize   why not  i don t know  but i heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallah saying so and he seems to know all about ships  charms 
but i sometimes thinkhe ll charm the ship to no good at last 
i don t half like that chap stubb 
did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carvedinto a snake s head  stubb   sink him 
i never look at him at all  but if ever i get a chance of adark night  and he standing hard by the bulwarks  and no one by  lookdown there  flask  pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of bothhands  aye  will i 
flask  i take that fedallah to be the devil indisguise 
do you believe that cock and bull story about his having beenstowed away on board ship 
he s the devil  i say 
the reason why youdon t see his tail  is because he tucks it up out of sight  he carriesit coiled away in his pocket  i guess 
blast him 
now that i think ofit  he s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots   he sleeps in his boots  don t he 
he hasn t got any hammock  but i veseen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging   no doubt  and it s because of his cursed tail  he coils it down  do yesee  in the eye of the rigging   what s the old man have so much to do with him for   striking up a swap or a bargain  i suppose   bargain  about what   why  do ye see  the old man is hard bent after that white whale  andthe devil there is trying to come round him  and get him to swap awayhis silver watch  or his soul  or something of that sort  and thenhe ll surrender moby dick   pooh 
stubb  you are skylarking  how can fedallah do that   i don t know  flask  but the devil is a curious chap  and a wickedone  i tell ye 
why  they say as how he went a sauntering into the oldflag ship once  switching his tail about devilish easy andgentlemanlike  and inquiring if the old governor was at home 
well  hewas at home  and asked the devil what he wanted 
the devil  switchinghis hoofs  up and says   i want john    what for   says the oldgovernor 
 what business is that of yours   says the devil  gettingmad   i want to use him    take him   says the governor and by thelord  flask  if the devil didn t give john the asiatic cholera beforehe got through with him  i ll eat this whale in one mouthful 
but looksharp ain t you all ready there 
well  then  pull ahead  and let s getthe whale alongside   i think i remember some such story as you were telling   said flask when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burdentowards the ship   but i can t remember where   three spaniards 
adventures of those three bloody minded soldadoes did ye read it there  flask 
i guess ye did   no  never saw such a book  heard of it  though 
but now  tell me stubb  do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now  wasthe same you say is now on board the pequod   am i the same man that helped kill this whale 
doesn t the devil livefor ever  who ever heard that the devil was dead 
did you ever see anyparson a wearing mourning for the devil 
and if the devil has alatch key to get into the admiral s cabin  don t you suppose he cancrawl into a porthole 
tell me that  mr  flask   how old do you suppose fedallah is  stubb   do you see that mainmast there   pointing to the ship   well  that sthe figure one  now take all the hoops in the pequod s hold  and stringalong in a row with that mast  for oughts  do you see  well  thatwouldn t begin to be fedallah s age 
nor all the coopers in creationcouldn t show hoops enough to make oughts enough   but see here  stubb  i thought you a little boasted just now  that youmeant to give fedallah a sea toss  if you got a good chance 
now  ifhe s so old as all those hoops of yours come to  and if he is going tolive for ever  what good will it do to pitch him overboard tell methat  give him a good ducking  anyhow   but he d crawl back   duck him again  and keep ducking him   suppose he should take it into his head to duck you  though yes  anddrown you what then   i should like to see him try it  i d give him such a pair of blackeyes that he wouldn t dare to show his face in the admiral s cabinagain for a long while  let alone down in the orlop there  where helives  and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much 
damnthe devil  flask  so you suppose i m afraid of the devil 
who s afraidof him  except the old governor who daresn t catch him and put him indouble darbies  as he deserves  but lets him go about kidnappingpeople  aye  and signed a bond with him  that all the people the devilkidnapped  he d roast for him 
there s a governor   do you suppose fedallah wants to kidnap captain ahab   do i suppose it 
you ll know it before long  flask 
but i am going nowto keep a sharp look out on him  and if i see anything very suspiciousgoing on  i ll just take him by the nape of his neck  and say lookhere  beelzebub  you don t do it  and if he makes any fuss  by the lordi ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail  take it to the capstan and give him such a wrenching and heaving  that his tail will comeshort off at the stump do you see  and then  i rather guess when hefinds himself docked in that queer fashion  he ll sneak off without thepoor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs   and what will you do with the tail  stubb   do with it 
sell it for an ox whip when we get home  what else   now  do you mean what you say  and have been saying all along  stubb   mean or not mean  here we are at the ship  the boats were here hailed  to tow the whale on the larboard side where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared forsecuring him  didn t i tell you so   said flask   yes  you ll soon see this rightwhale s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti s  in good time  flask s saying proved true 
as before  the pequod steeplyleaned over towards the sperm whale s head  now  by the counterpoise ofboth heads  she regained her even keel  though sorely strained  you maywell believe 
so  when on one side you hoist in locke s head  you goover that way  but now  on the other side  hoist in kant s and you comeback again  but in very poor plight 
thus  some minds for ever keeptrimming boat 
oh  ye foolish 
throw all these thunder heads overboard and then you will float light and right in disposing of the body of a right whale  when brought alongside theship  the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in thecase of a sperm whale  only  in the latter instance  the head is cutoff whole  but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removedand hoisted on deck  with all the well known black bone attached towhat is called the crown piece 
but nothing like this  in the presentcase  had been done 
the carcases of both whales had dropped astern and the head laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pairof overburdening panniers meantime  fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale s head  and everand anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his ownhand 
and ahab chanced so to stand  that the parsee occupied hisshadow  while  if the parsee s shadow was there at all it seemed onlyto blend with  and lengthen ahab s 
as the crew toiled on  laplandishspeculations were bandied among them  concerning all these passingthings chapter 74 
the sperm whale s head contrasted view here  now  are two great whales  laying their heads together  let usjoin them  and lay together our own of the grand order of folio leviathans  the sperm whale and the rightwhale are by far the most noteworthy 
they are the only whalesregularly hunted by man 
to the nantucketer  they present the twoextremes of all the known varieties of the whale 
as the externaldifference between them is mainly observable in their heads  and as ahead of each is this moment hanging from the pequod s side  and as wemay freely go from one to the other  by merely stepping across thedeck  where  i should like to know  will you obtain a better chance tostudy practical cetology than here in the first place  you are struck by the general contrast betweenthese heads 
both are massive enough in all conscience  but there is acertain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whale s which the rightwhale s sadly lacks 
there is more character in the sperm whale s head as you behold it  you involuntarily yield the immense superiority tohim  in point of pervading dignity 
in the present instance  too  thisdignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at thesummit  giving token of advanced age and large experience 
in short  heis what the fishermen technically call a  grey headed whale  let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads namely  the twomost important organs  the eye and the ear 
far back on the side of thehead  and low down  near the angle of either whale s jaw  if younarrowly search  you will at last see a lashless eye  which you wouldfancy to be a young colt s eye  so out of all proportion is it to themagnitude of the head now  from this peculiar sideway position of the whale s eyes  it isplain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead  no morethan he can one exactly astern 
in a word  the position of the whale seyes corresponds to that of a man s ears  and you may fancy  foryourself  how it would fare with you  did you sideways survey objectsthrough your ears 
you would find that you could only command somethirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side line of sight and about thirty more behind it 
if your bitterest foe were walkingstraight towards you  with dagger uplifted in broad day  you would notbe able to see him  any more than if he were stealing upon you frombehind 
in a word  you would have two backs  so to speak  but  at thesame time  also  two fronts  side fronts   for what is it that makesthe front of a man what  indeed  but his eyes moreover  while in most other animals that i can now think of  the eyesare so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power  so as toproduce one picture and not two to the brain  the peculiar position ofthe whale s eyes  effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet ofsolid head  which towers between them like a great mountain separatingtwo lakes in valleys  this  of course  must wholly separate theimpressions which each independent organ imparts 
the whale  therefore must see one distinct picture on this side  and another distinctpicture on that side  while all between must be profound darkness andnothingness to him 
man may  in effect  be said to look out on theworld from a sentry box with two joined sashes for his window 
but withthe whale  these two sashes are separately inserted  making twodistinct windows  but sadly impairing the view 
this peculiarity of thewhale s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery  andto be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning thisvisual matter as touching the leviathan 
but i must be content with ahint 
so long as a man s eyes are open in the light  the act of seeingis involuntary  that is  he cannot then help mechanically seeingwhatever objects are before him 
nevertheless  any one s experiencewill teach him  that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep ofthings at one glance  it is quite impossible for him  attentively  andcompletely  to examine any two things however large or however small atone and the same instant of time  never mind if they lie side by sideand touch each other 
but if you now come to separate these twoobjects  and surround each by a circle of profound darkness  then  inorder to see one of them  in such a manner as to bring your mind tobear on it  the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporaryconsciousness 
how is it  then  with the whale 
true  both his eyes  inthemselves  must simultaneously act  but is his brain so much morecomprehensive  combining  and subtle than man s  that he can at thesame moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects  one onone side of him  and the other in an exactly opposite direction 
if hecan  then is it as marvellous a thing in him  as if a man were ablesimultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinctproblems in euclid 
nor  strictly investigated  is there anyincongruity in this comparison it may be but an idle whim  but it has always seemed to me  that theextraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales whenbeset by three or four boats  the timidity and liability to queerfrights  so common to such whales  i think that all this indirectlyproceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition  in which theirdivided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye 
if you are anentire stranger to their race  you might hunt over these two heads forhours  and never discover that organ 
the ear has no external leafwhatever  and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill  sowondrously minute is it 
it is lodged a little behind the eye 
withrespect to their ears  this important difference is to be observedbetween the sperm whale and the right 
while the ear of the former hasan external opening  that of the latter is entirely and evenly coveredover with a membrane  so as to be quite imperceptible from without is it not curious  that so vast a being as the whale should see theworld through so small an eye  and hear the thunder through an earwhich is smaller than a hare s 
but if his eyes were broad as the lensof herschel s great telescope  and his ears capacious as the porches ofcathedrals  would that make him any longer of sight  or sharper ofhearing 
not at all  why then do you try to  enlarge  your mind subtilize it let us now with whatever levers and steam engines we have at hand  cantover the sperm whale s head  that it may lie bottom up  then  ascendingby a ladder to the summit  have a peep down the mouth  and were it notthat the body is now completely separated from it  with a lantern wemight descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach 
butlet us hold on here by this tooth  and look about us where we are 
whata really beautiful and chaste looking mouth 
from floor to ceiling lined  or rather papered with a glistening white membrane  glossy asbridal satins but come out now  and look at this portentous lower jaw  which seemslike the long narrow lid of an immense snuff box  with the hinge at oneend  instead of one side 
if you pry it up  so as to get it overhead and expose its rows of teeth  it seems a terrific portcullis  and such alas 
it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery  upon whom thesespikes fall with impaling force 
but far more terrible is it to behold when fathoms down in the sea  you see some sulky whale  floating theresuspended  with his prodigious jaw  some fifteen feet long  hangingstraight down at right angles with his body  for all the world like aship s jib boom 
this whale is not dead  he is only dispirited  out ofsorts  perhaps  hypochondriac  and so supine  that the hinges of hisjaw have relaxed  leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight  areproach to all his tribe  who must  no doubt  imprecate lock jaws uponhim in most cases this lower jaw being easily unhinged by a practisedartist is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extractingthe ivory teeth  and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebonewith which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles including canes  umbrella stocks  and handles to riding whips with a long  weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board  as if it were ananchor  and when the proper time comes some few days after the otherwork queequeg  daggoo  and tashtego  being all accomplished dentists are set to drawing teeth 
with a keen cutting spade  queequeg lancesthe gums  then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts  and a tackle beingrigged from aloft  they drag out these teeth  as michigan oxen dragstumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands 
there are generallyforty two teeth in all  in old whales  much worn down  but undecayed nor filled after our artificial fashion 
the jaw is afterwards sawninto slabs  and piled away like joists for building houses chapter 75 
the right whale s head contrasted view crossing the deck  let us now have a good long look at the rightwhale s head as in general shape the noble sperm whale s head may be compared to aroman war chariot  especially in front  where it is so broadlyrounded   so  at a broad view  the right whale s head bears a ratherinelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot toed shoe 
two hundredyears ago an old dutch voyager likened its shape to that of ashoemaker s last 
and in this same last or shoe  that old woman of thenursery tale  with the swarming brood  might very comfortably belodged  she and all her progeny but as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume differentaspects  according to your point of view 
if you stand on its summitand look at these two f shaped spoutholes  you would take the wholehead for an enormous bass viol  and these spiracles  the apertures inits sounding board 
then  again  if you fix your eye upon this strange crested  comb like incrustation on the top of the mass this green barnacled thing  which the greenlanders call the  crown   and thesouthern fishers the  bonnet  of the right whale  fixing your eyessolely on this  you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak with a bird s nest in its crotch 
at any rate  when you watch thoselive crabs that nestle here on this bonnet  such an idea will be almostsure to occur to you  unless  indeed  your fancy has been fixed by thetechnical term  crown  also bestowed upon it  in which case you willtake great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually adiademed king of the sea  whose green crown has been put together forhim in this marvellous manner 
but if this whale be a king  he is avery sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem 
look at that hanging lowerlip 
what a huge sulk and pout is there 
a sulk and pout  bycarpenter s measurement  about twenty feet long and five feet deep  asulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more a great pity  now  that this unfortunate whale should be hare lipped the fissure is about a foot across 
probably the mother during animportant interval was sailing down the peruvian coast  whenearthquakes caused the beach to gape 
over this lip  as over a slipperythreshold  we now slide into the mouth 
upon my word were i atmackinaw  i should take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam 
is this the road that jonah went 
the roof is about twelve feethigh  and runs to a pretty sharp angle  as if there were a regularridge pole there  while these ribbed  arched  hairy sides  present uswith those wondrous  half vertical  scimetar shaped slats of whalebone say three hundred on a side  which depending from the upper part of thehead or crown bone  form those venetian blinds which have elsewherebeen cursorily mentioned 
the edges of these bones are fringed withhairy fibres  through which the right whale strains the water  and inwhose intricacies he retains the small fish  when openmouthed he goesthrough the seas of brit in feeding time 
in the central blinds ofbone  as they stand in their natural order  there are certain curiousmarks  curves  hollows  and ridges  whereby some whalemen calculate thecreature s age  as the age of an oak by its circular rings 
though thecertainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable  yet it has thesavor of analogical probability 
at any rate  if we yield to it  wemust grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glancewill seem reasonable in old times  there seem to have prevailed the most curious fanciesconcerning these blinds 
one voyager in purchas calls them the wondrous whiskers  inside of the whale s mouth   another   hogs  bristles   athird old gentleman in hackluyt uses the following elegant language  there are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of hisupper chop  which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth   this reminds us that the right whale really has a sort of whisker  orrather a moustache  consisting of a few scattered white hairs on theupper part of the outer end of the lower jaw 
sometimes these tuftsimpart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemncountenance as every one knows  these same  hogs  bristles    fins    whiskers   blinds   or whatever you please  furnish to the ladies their busks andother stiffening contrivances 
but in this particular  the demand haslong been on the decline 
it was in queen anne s time that the bone wasin its glory  the farthingale being then all the fashion 
and as thoseancient dames moved about gaily  though in the jaws of the whale  asyou may say  even so  in a shower  with the like thoughtlessness  do wenowadays fly under the same jaws for protection  the umbrella being atent spread over the same bone but now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment  and standing in the right whale s mouth  look around you afresh 
seeing allthese colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about  would you notthink you were inside of the great haarlem organ  and gazing upon itsthousand pipes 
for a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softestturkey the tongue  which is glued  as it were  to the floor of themouth 
it is very fat and tender  and apt to tear in pieces in hoistingit on deck 
this particular tongue now before us  at a passing glance ishould say it was a six barreler  that is  it will yield you about thatamount of oil ere this  you must have plainly seen the truth of what i startedwith that the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirelydifferent heads 
to sum up  then  in the right whale s there is nogreat well of sperm  no ivory teeth at all  no long  slender mandibleof a lower jaw  like the sperm whale s 
nor in the sperm whale arethere any of those blinds of bone  no huge lower lip  and scarcelyanything of a tongue 
again  the right whale has two externalspout holes  the sperm whale only one look your last  now  on these venerable hooded heads  while they yetlie together  for one will soon sink  unrecorded  in the sea  the otherwill not be very long in following can you catch the expression of the sperm whale s there 
it is the samehe died with  only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem nowfaded away 
i think his broad brow to be full of a prairie likeplacidity  born of a speculative indifference as to death 
but mark theother head s expression 
see that amazing lower lip  pressed byaccident against the vessel s side  so as firmly to embrace the jaw does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practicalresolution in facing death 
this right whale i take to have been astoic  the sperm whale  a platonian  who might have taken up spinoza inhis latter years chapter 76 
the battering ram ere quitting  for the nonce  the sperm whale s head  i would have you as a sensible physiologist  simply particularly remark its frontaspect  in all its compacted collectedness 
i would have youinvestigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself someunexaggerated  intelligent estimate of whatever battering ram power maybe lodged there 
here is a vital point  for you must eithersatisfactorily settle this matter with yourself  or for ever remain aninfidel as to one of the most appalling  but not the less true events perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history you observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to thewater  you observe that the lower part of that front slopesconsiderably backwards  so as to furnish more of a retreat for the longsocket which receives the boom like lower jaw  you observe that themouth is entirely under the head  much in the same way  indeed  asthough your own mouth were entirely under your chin 
moreover youobserve that the whale has no external nose  and that what nose hehas his spout hole is on the top of his head  you observe that his eyesand ears are at the sides of his head  nearly one third of his entirelength from the front 
wherefore  you must now have perceived that thefront of the sperm whale s head is a dead  blind wall  without a singleorgan or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever 
furthermore  you arenow to consider that only in the extreme  lower  backward sloping partof the front of the head  is there the slightest vestige of bone  andnot till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to thefull cranial development 
so that this whole enormous boneless mass isas one wad 
finally  though  as will soon be revealed  its contentspartly comprise the most delicate oil  yet  you are now to be apprisedof the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all thatapparent effeminacy 
in some previous place i have described to you howthe blubber wraps the body of the whale  as the rind wraps an orange just so with the head  but with this difference  about the head thisenvelope  though not so thick  is of a boneless toughness  inestimableby any man who has not handled it 
the severest pointed harpoon  thesharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm  impotently reboundsfrom it 
it is as though the forehead of the sperm whale were pavedwith horses  hoofs 
i do not think that any sensation lurks in it bethink yourself also of another thing 
when two large  loaded indiamenchance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks  what do thesailors do 
they do not suspend between them  at the point of comingcontact  any merely hard substance  like iron or wood 
no  they holdthere a large  round wad of tow and cork  enveloped in the thickest andtoughest of ox hide 
that bravely and uninjured takes the jam whichwould have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow bars 
byitself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact i drive at 
butsupplementary to this  it has hypothetically occurred to me  that asordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them capable  at will  of distension or contraction  and as the sperm whale as far as i know  has no such provision in him  considering  too  theotherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his headaltogether beneath the surface  and anon swims with it high elevatedout of the water  considering the unobstructed elasticity of itsenvelope  considering the unique interior of his head  it hashypothetically occurred to me  i say  that those mystical lung celledhoneycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown andunsuspected connexion with the outer air  so as to be susceptible toatmospheric distension and contraction 
if this be so  fancy theirresistibleness of that might  to which the most impalpable anddestructive of all elements contributes now  mark 
unerringly impelling this dead  impregnable  uninjurablewall  and this most buoyant thing within  there swims behind it all amass of tremendous life  only to be adequately estimated as piled woodis by the cord  and all obedient to one volition  as the smallestinsect 
so that when i shall hereafter detail to you all thespecialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in thisexpansive monster  when i shall show you some of his moreinconsiderable braining feats  i trust you will have renounced allignorant incredulity  and be ready to abide by this  that though thesperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien  and mixedthe atlantic with the pacific  you would not elevate one hair of youreye brow 
for unless you own the whale  you are but a provincial andsentimentalist in truth 
but clear truth is a thing for salamandergiants only to encounter  how small the chances for the provincialsthen

the great heidelburgh tun now comes the baling of the case 
but to comprehend it aright  you mustknow something of the curious internal structure of the thing operatedupon regarding the sperm whale s head as a solid oblong  you may  on aninclined plane  sideways divide it into two quoins   whereof the loweris the bony structure  forming the cranium and jaws  and the upper anunctuous mass wholly free from bones  its broad forward end forming theexpanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale 
at the middle of theforehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin  and then you have twoalmost equal parts  which before were naturally divided by an internalwall of a thick tendinous substance 
 quoin is not a euclidean term 
it belongs to the pure nauticalmathematics 
i know not that it has been defined before 
a quoin is asolid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by thesteep inclination of one side  instead of the mutual tapering of bothsides the lower subdivided part  called the junk  is one immense honeycomb ofoil  formed by the crossing and recrossing  into ten thousandinfiltrated cells  of tough elastic white fibres throughout its wholeextent 
the upper part  known as the case  may be regarded as the greatheidelburgh tun of the sperm whale 
and as that famous great tierce ismystically carved in front  so the whale s vast plaited forehead formsinnumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of hiswondrous tun 
moreover  as that of heidelburgh was always replenishedwith the most excellent of the wines of the rhenish valleys  so the tunof the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oilyvintages  namely  the highly prized spermaceti  in its absolutely pure limpid  and odoriferous state 
nor is this precious substance foundunalloyed in any other part of the creature 
though in life it remainsperfectly fluid  yet  upon exposure to the air  after death  it soonbegins to concrete  sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots  as whenthe first thin delicate ice is just forming in water 
a large whale scase generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm  though fromunavoidable circumstances  considerable of it is spilled  leaks  anddribbles away  or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklishbusiness of securing what you can i know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun wascoated within  but in superlative richness that coating could notpossibly have compared with the silken pearl coloured membrane  likethe lining of a fine pelisse  forming the inner surface of the spermwhale s case it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whaleembraces the entire length of the entire top of the head  and since ashas been elsewhere set forth the head embraces one third of the wholelength of the creature  then setting that length down at eighty feetfor a good sized whale  you have more than twenty six feet for thedepth of the tun  when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against aship s side as in decapitating the whale  the operator s instrument is broughtclose to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into thespermaceti magazine  he has  therefore  to be uncommonly heedful  lesta careless  untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastinglylet out its invaluable contents 
it is this decapitated end of thehead  also  which is at last elevated out of the water  and retained inthat position by the enormous cutting tackles  whose hempencombinations  on one side  make quite a wilderness of ropes in thatquarter thus much being said  attend now  i pray you  to that marvellous and inthis particular instance almost fatal operation whereby the spermwhale s great heidelburgh tun is tapped chapter 78 
cistern and buckets nimble as a cat  tashtego mounts aloft  and without altering his erectposture  runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard arm  to thepart where it exactly projects over the hoisted tun 
he has carriedwith him a light tackle called a whip  consisting of only two parts travelling through a single sheaved block 
securing this block  so thatit hangs down from the yard arm  he swings one end of the rope  till itis caught and firmly held by a hand on deck 
then  hand over hand  downthe other part  the indian drops through the air  till dexterously helands on the summit of the head 
there still high elevated above therest of the company  to whom he vivaciously cries he seems some turkishmuezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower 
ashort handled sharp spade being sent up to him  he diligently searchesfor the proper place to begin breaking into the tun 
in this businesshe proceeds very heedfully  like a treasure hunter in some old house sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in 
by the timethis cautious search is over  a stout iron bound bucket  precisely likea well bucket  has been attached to one end of the whip  while theother end  being stretched across the deck  is there held by two orthree alert hands 
these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of theindian  to whom another person has reached up a very long pole inserting this pole into the bucket  tashtego downward guides thebucket into the tun  till it entirely disappears  then giving the wordto the seamen at the whip  up comes the bucket again  all bubbling likea dairy maid s pail of new milk 
carefully lowered from its height  thefull freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand  and quicklyemptied into a large tub 
then remounting aloft  it again goes throughthe same round until the deep cistern will yield no more 
towards theend  tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder  and deeperand deeper into the tun  until some twenty feet of the pole have gonedown now  the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this way several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm  when all at oncea queer accident happened 
whether it was that tashtego  that wildindian  was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment hisone handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head  orwhether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy  orwhether the evil one himself would have it to fall out so  withoutstating his particular reasons  how it was exactly  there is no tellingnow  but  on a sudden  as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket camesuckingly up my god 
poor tashtego like the twin reciprocating bucketin a veritable well  dropped head foremost down into this great tun ofheidelburgh  and with a horrible oily gurgling  went clean out ofsight  man overboard   cried daggoo  who amid the general consternation firstcame to his senses 
 swing the bucket this way   and putting one footinto it  so as the better to secure his slippery hand hold on the whipitself  the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head  almostbefore tashtego could have reached its interior bottom 
meantime  therewas a terrible tumult 
looking over the side  they saw the beforelifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea as if that moment seized with some momentous idea  whereas it was onlythe poor indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilousdepth to which he had sunk at this instant  while daggoo  on the summit of the head  was clearingthe whip which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles asharp cracking noise was heard  and to the unspeakable horror of all one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out  and with avast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung  till the drunk shipreeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg 
the one remaining hook upon which the entire strain now depended  seemed every instant to beon the point of giving way  an event still more likely from the violentmotions of the head  come down  come down   yelled the seamen to daggoo  but with one handholding on to the heavy tackles  so that if the head should drop  hewould still remain suspended  the negro having cleared the foul line rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well  meaning that theburied harpooneer should grasp it  and so be hoisted out  in heaven s name  man   cried stubb   are you ramming home a cartridgethere  avast 
how will that help him  jamming that iron bound bucket ontop of his head 
avast  will ye   stand clear of the tackle   cried a voice like the bursting of arocket almost in the same instant  with a thunder boom  the enormous massdropped into the sea  like niagara s table rock into the whirlpool  thesuddenly relieved hull rolled away from it  to far down her glitteringcopper  and all caught their breath  as half swinging now over thesailors  heads  and now over the water daggoo  through a thick mist ofspray  was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles  while poor buried alive tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of thesea 
but hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away  when a nakedfigure with a boarding sword in his hand  was for one swift moment seenhovering over the bulwarks 
the next  a loud splash announced that mybrave queequeg had dived to the rescue 
one packed rush was made to theside  and every eye counted every ripple  as moment followed moment and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen 
some handsnow jumped into a boat alongside  and pushed a little off from theship  ha 
ha   cried daggoo  all at once  from his now quiet  swinging perchoverhead  and looking further off from the side  we saw an arm thrustupright from the blue waves  a sight strange to see  as an arm thrustforth from the grass over a grave  both 
both  it is both   cried daggoo again with a joyful shout  andsoon after  queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand  andwith the other clutching the long hair of the indian 
drawn into thewaiting boat  they were quickly brought to the deck  but tashtego waslong in coming to  and queequeg did not look very brisk now  how had this noble rescue been accomplished 
why  diving after theslowly descending head  queequeg with his keen sword had made sidelunges near its bottom  so as to scuttle a large hole there  thendropping his sword  had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards and so hauled out poor tash by the head 
he averred  that upon firstthrusting in for him  a leg was presented  but well knowing that thatwas not as it ought to be  and might occasion great trouble  he hadthrust back the leg  and by a dexterous heave and toss  had wrought asomerset upon the indian  so that with the next trial  he came forth inthe good old way head foremost 
as for the great head itself  that wasdoing as well as could be expected and thus  through the courage and great skill in obstetrics ofqueequeg  the deliverance  or rather  delivery of tashtego  wassuccessfully accomplished  in the teeth  too  of the most untoward andapparently hopeless impediments  which is a lesson by no means to beforgotten 
midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencingand boxing  riding and rowing i know that this queer adventure of the gay header s will be sure toseem incredible to some landsmen  though they themselves may haveeither seen or heard of some one s falling into a cistern ashore  anaccident which not seldom happens  and with much less reason too thanthe indian s  considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of thesperm whale s well but  peradventure  it may be sagaciously urged  how is this 
we thoughtthe tissued  infiltrated head of the sperm whale  was the lightest andmost corky part about him  and yet thou makest it sink in an element ofa far greater specific gravity than itself 
we have thee there 
not atall  but i have ye  for at the time poor tash fell in  the case hadbeen nearly emptied of its lighter contents  leaving little but thedense tendinous wall of the well a double welded  hammered substance as i have before said  much heavier than the sea water  and a lump ofwhich sinks in it like lead almost 
but the tendency to rapid sinkingin this substance was in the present instance materially counteractedby the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it  so that itsank very slowly and deliberately indeed  affording queequeg a fairchance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run  as you may say yes  it was a running delivery  so it was now  had tashtego perished in that head  it had been a very preciousperishing  smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrantspermaceti  coffined  hearsed  and tombed in the secret inner chamberand sanctum sanctorum of the whale 
only one sweeter end can readily berecalled the delicious death of an ohio honey hunter  who seeking honeyin the crotch of a hollow tree  found such exceeding store of it  thatleaning too far over  it sucked him in  so that he died embalmed

the prairie to scan the lines of his face  or feel the bumps on the head of thisleviathan  this is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist hasas yet undertaken 
such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful asfor lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the rock of gibraltar or for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the dome of thepantheon 
still  in that famous work of his  lavater not only treats ofthe various faces of men  but also attentively studies the faces ofhorses  birds  serpents  and fish  and dwells in detail upon themodifications of expression discernible therein 
nor have gall and hisdisciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching thephrenological characteristics of other beings than man 
therefore though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer  in the application ofthese two semi sciences to the whale  i will do my endeavor 
i try allthings  i achieve what i can physiognomically regarded  the sperm whale is an anomalous creature 
hehas no proper nose 
and since the nose is the central and mostconspicuous of the features  and since it perhaps most modifies andfinally controls their combined expression  hence it would seem thatits entire absence  as an external appendage  must very largely affectthe countenance of the whale 
for as in landscape gardening  a spire cupola  monument  or tower of some sort  is deemed almost indispensableto the completion of the scene  so no face can be physiognomically inkeeping without the elevated open work belfry of the nose 
dash thenose from phidias s marble jove  and what a sorry remainder nevertheless  leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude  all hisproportions are so stately  that the same deficiency which in thesculptured jove were hideous  in him is no blemish at all 
nay  it isan added grandeur 
a nose to the whale would have been impertinent 
ason your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in yourjolly boat  your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by thereflection that he has a nose to be pulled 
a pestilent conceit  whichso often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiestroyal beadle on his throne in some particulars  perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view tobe had of the sperm whale  is that of the full front of his head 
thisaspect is sublime in thought  a fine human brow is like the east when troubled with themorning 
in the repose of the pasture  the curled brow of the bull hasa touch of the grand in it 
pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles the elephant s brow is majestic 
human or animal  the mystical brow isas that great golden seal affixed by the german emperors to theirdecrees 
it signifies  god  done this day by my hand   but in mostcreatures  nay in man himself  very often the brow is but a mere stripof alpine land lying along the snow line 
few are the foreheads whichlike shakespeare s or melancthon s rise so high  and descend so low that the eyes themselves seem clear  eternal  tideless mountain lakes and all above them in the forehead s wrinkles  you seem to track theantlered thoughts descending there to drink  as the highland hunterstrack the snow prints of the deer 
but in the great sperm whale  thishigh and mighty god like dignity inherent in the brow is so immenselyamplified  that gazing on it  in that full front view  you feel thedeity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any otherobject in living nature 
for you see no one point precisely  not onedistinct feature is revealed  no nose  eyes  ears  or mouth  no face he has none  proper  nothing but that one broad firmament of aforehead  pleated with riddles  dumbly lowering with the doom of boats and ships  and men 
nor  in profile  does this wondrous brow diminish though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so 
inprofile  you plainly perceive that horizontal  semi crescenticdepression in the forehead s middle  which  in man  is lavater s markof genius but how 
genius in the sperm whale 
has the sperm whale ever written abook  spoken a speech 
no  his great genius is declared in his doingnothing particular to prove it 
it is moreover declared in hispyramidical silence 
and this reminds me that had the great sperm whalebeen known to the young orient world  he would have been deified bytheir child magian thoughts 
they deified the crocodile of the nile because the crocodile is tongueless  and the sperm whale has no tongue or at least it is so exceedingly small  as to be incapable ofprotrusion 
if hereafter any highly cultured  poetical nation shalllure back to their birth right  the merry may day gods of old  andlivingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky  in the nowunhaunted hill  then be sure  exalted to jove s high seat  the greatsperm whale shall lord it champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics 
but there isno champollion to decipher the egypt of every man s and every being sface 
physiognomy  like every other human science  is but a passingfable 
if then  sir william jones  who read in thirty languages  couldnot read the simplest peasant s face in its profounder and more subtlemeanings  how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldee ofthe sperm whale s brow 
i but put that brow before you 
read it if youcan chapter 80 
the nut if the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx  to the phrenologisthis brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible tosquare in the full grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feetin length 
unhinge the lower jaw  and the side view of this skull is asthe side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a levelbase 
but in life as we have elsewhere seen this inclined plane isangularly filled up  and almost squared by the enormous superincumbentmass of the junk and sperm 
at the high end the skull forms a crater tobed that part of the mass  while under the long floor of this crater inanother cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many indepth reposes the mere handful of this monster s brain 
the brain is atleast twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life  it is hidden awaybehind its vast outworks  like the innermost citadel within theamplified fortifications of quebec 
so like a choice casket is itsecreted in him  that i have known some whalemen who peremptorily denythat the sperm whale has any other brain than that palpable semblanceof one formed by the cubic yards of his sperm magazine 
lying instrange folds  courses  and convolutions  to their apprehensions  itseems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard thatmystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence it is plain  then  that phrenologically the head of this leviathan  inthe creature s living intact state  is an entire delusion 
as for histrue brain  you can then see no indications of it  nor feel any 
thewhale  like all things that are mighty  wears a false brow to thecommon world if you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear viewof its rear end  which is the high end  you will be struck by itsresemblance to the human skull  beheld in the same situation  and fromthe same point of view 
indeed  place this reversed skull  scaled downto the human magnitude  among a plate of men s skulls  and you wouldinvoluntarily confound it with them  and remarking the depressions onone part of its summit  in phrenological phrase you would say this manhad no self esteem  and no veneration 
and by those negations considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk andpower  you can best form to yourself the truest  though not the mostexhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is but if from the comparative dimensions of the whale s proper brain  youdeem it incapable of being adequately charted  then i have another ideafor you 
if you attentively regard almost any quadruped s spine  youwill be struck with the resemblance of its vertebræ to a strungnecklace of dwarfed skulls  all bearing rudimental resemblance to theskull proper 
it is a german conceit  that the vertebræ are absolutelyundeveloped skulls 
but the curious external resemblance  i take it thegermans were not the first men to perceive 
a foreign friend oncepointed it out to me  in the skeleton of a foe he had slain  and withthe vertebræ of which he was inlaying  in a sort of basso relievo  thebeaked prow of his canoe 
now  i consider that the phrenologists haveomitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from thecerebellum through the spinal canal 
for i believe that much of a man scharacter will be found betokened in his backbone 
i would rather feelyour spine than your skull  whoever you are 
a thin joist of a spinenever yet upheld a full and noble soul 
i rejoice in my spine  as inthe firm audacious staff of that flag which i fling half out to theworld apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale 
his cranialcavity is continuous with the first neck vertebra  and in that vertebrathe bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across  beingeight in height  and of a triangular figure with the base downwards 
asit passes through the remaining vertebræ the canal tapers in size  butfor a considerable distance remains of large capacity 
now  of course this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance thespinal cord as the brain  and directly communicates with the brain 
andwhat is still more  for many feet after emerging from the brain scavity  the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth  almost equalto that of the brain 
under all these circumstances  would it beunreasonable to survey and map out the whale s spine phrenologically for  viewed in this light  the wonderful comparative smallness of hisbrain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparativemagnitude of his spinal cord but leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists  iwould merely assume the spinal theory for a moment  in reference to thesperm whale s hump 
this august hump  if i mistake not  rises over oneof the larger vertebræ  and is  therefore  in some sort  the outerconvex mould of it 
from its relative situation then  i should callthis high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the spermwhale 
and that the great monster is indomitable  you will yet havereason to know chapter 81 
the pequod meets the virgin the predestinated day arrived  and we duly met the ship jungfrau derick de deer  master  of bremen at one time the greatest whaling people in the world  the dutch andgermans are now among the least  but here and there at very wideintervals of latitude and longitude  you still occasionally meet withtheir flag in the pacific for some reason  the jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects while yet some distance from the pequod  she rounded to  and dropping aboat  her captain was impelled towards us  impatiently standing in thebows instead of the stern  what has he in his hand there   cried starbuck  pointing to somethingwavingly held by the german

there were eight whales  an average pod 
aware of theirdanger  they were going all abreast with great speed straight beforethe wind  rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses inharness 
they left a great  wide wake  as though continually unrollinga great wide parchment upon the sea full in this rapid wake  and many fathoms in the rear  swam a huge humped old bull  which by his comparatively slow progress  as well asby the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him  seemedafflicted with the jaundice  or some other infirmity 
whether thiswhale belonged to the pod in advance  seemed questionable  for it isnot customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social nevertheless  he stuck to their wake  though indeed their back watermust have retarded him  because the white bone or swell at his broadmuzzle was a dashed one  like the swell formed when two hostilecurrents meet 
his spout was short  slow  and laborious  coming forthwith a choking sort of gush  and spending itself in torn shreds followed by strange subterranean commotions in him  which seemed tohave egress at his other buried extremity  causing the waters behindhim to upbubble  who s got some paregoric   said stubb   he has the stomach ache  i mafraid 
lord  think of having half an acre of stomach ache 
adversewinds are holding mad christmas in him  boys 
it s the first foul windi ever knew to blow from astern  but look  did ever whale yaw sobefore 
it must be  he s lost his tiller  as an overladen indiaman bearing down the hindostan coast with a deckload of frightened horses  careens  buries  rolls  and wallows on herway  so did this old whale heave his aged bulk  and now and then partlyturning over on his cumbrous rib ends  expose the cause of his deviouswake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin 
whether he had lostthat fin in battle  or had been born without it  it were hard to say  only wait a bit  old chap  and i ll give ye a sling for that woundedarm   cried cruel flask  pointing to the whale line near him  mind he don t sling thee with it   cried starbuck 
 give way  or thegerman will have him  with one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this onefish  because not only was he the largest  and therefore the mostvaluable whale  but he was nearest to them  and the other whales weregoing with such great velocity  moreover  as almost to defy pursuit forthe time 
at this juncture the pequod s keels had shot by the threegerman boats last lowered  but from the great start he had had derick s boat still led the chase  though every moment neared by hisforeign rivals 
the only thing they feared  was  that from beingalready so nigh to his mark  he would be enabled to dart his ironbefore they could completely overtake and pass him 
as for derick  heseemed quite confident that this would be the case  and occasionallywith a deriding gesture shook his lamp feeder at the other boats  the ungracious and ungrateful dog   cried starbuck   he mocks anddares me with the very poor box i filled for him not five minutesago   then in his old intense whisper  give way  greyhounds

what d ye say tashtego  are you the man to snap your spine in two and twenty piecesfor the honor of old gayhead 
what d ye say   i say  pull like god dam   cried the indian fiercely  but evenly incited by the taunts of the german  the pequod sthree boats now began ranging almost abreast  and  so disposed momentarily neared him 
in that fine  loose  chivalrous attitude of theheadsman when drawing near to his prey  the three mates stood upproudly  occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilaratingcry of   there she slides  now 
hurrah for the white ash breeze 
downwith the yarman 
sail over him  but so decided an original start had derick had  that spite of alltheir gallantry  he would have proved the victor in this race  had nota righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught theblade of his midship oarsman 
while this clumsy lubber was striving tofree his white ash  and while  in consequence  derick s boat was nighto capsizing  and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage  thatwas a good time for starbuck  stubb  and flask 
with a shout  they tooka mortal start forwards  and slantingly ranged up on the german squarter 
an instant more  and all four boats were diagonically in thewhale s immediate wake  while stretching from them  on both sides  wasthe foaming swell that he made it was a terrific  most pitiable  and maddening sight 
the whale wasnow going head out  and sending his spout before him in a continualtormented jet  while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony offright 
now to this hand  now to that  he yawed in his falteringflight  and still at every billow that he broke  he spasmodically sankin the sea  or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin 
sohave i seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circlesin the air  vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks 
but the birdhas a voice  and with plaintive cries will make known her fear  but thefear of this vast dumb brute of the sea  was chained up and enchantedin him  he had no voice  save that choking respiration through hisspiracle  and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable  whilestill  in his amazing bulk  portcullis jaw  and omnipotent tail  therewas enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the pequod sboats the advantage  and rather than be thus foiled of his game  derickchose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually longdart  ere the last chance would for ever escape but no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke  than allthree tigers queequeg  tashtego  daggoo instinctively sprang to theirfeet  and standing in a diagonal row  simultaneously pointed theirbarbs  and darted over the head of the german harpooneer  their threenantucket irons entered the whale 
blinding vapors of foam andwhite fire 
the three boats  in the first fury of the whale s headlongrush  bumped the german s aside with such force  that both derick andhis baffled harpooneer were spilled out  and sailed over by the threeflying keels  don t be afraid  my butter boxes   cried stubb  casting a passingglance upon them as he shot by   ye ll be picked up presently allright i saw some sharks astern st 
bernard s dogs  you know relievedistressed travellers 
this is the way to sail now 
every keela sunbeam 
hurrah  here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of amad cougar 
this puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in atilbury on a plain makes the wheel spokes fly  boys  when you fasten tohim that way  and there s danger of being pitched out too  when youstrike a hill 
this is the way a fellow feels when he s goingto davy jones all a rush down an endless inclined plane 
thiswhale carries the everlasting mail  but the monster s run was a brief one 
giving a sudden gasp  hetumultuously sounded 
with a grating rush  the three lines flew roundthe loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding wouldsoon exhaust the lines  that using all their dexterous might  theycaught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on  till atlast owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead lined chocks ofthe boats  whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue thegunwales of the bows were almost even with the water  while the threesterns tilted high in the air 
and the whale soon ceasing to sound  forsome time they remained in that attitude  fearful of expending moreline  though the position was a little ticklish 
but though boats havebeen taken down and lost in this way  yet it is this  holding on   asit is called  this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh fromthe back  this it is that often torments the leviathan into soon risingagain to meet the sharp lance of his foes 
yet not to speak of theperil of the thing  it is to be doubted whether this course is alwaysthe best  for it is but reasonable to presume  that the longer thestricken whale stays under water  the more he is exhausted 
because owing to the enormous surface of him in a full grown sperm whalesomething less than 2000 square feet the pressure of the water isimmense 
we all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight weourselves stand up under  even here  above ground  in the air  howvast  then  the burden of a whale  bearing on his back a column of twohundred fathoms of ocean 
it must at least equal the weight of fiftyatmospheres 
one whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twentyline of battle ships  with all their guns  and stores  and men onboard as the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea  gazing downinto its eternal blue noon  and as not a single groan or cry of anysort  nay  not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths what landsman would have thought  that beneath all that silence andplacidity  the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching inagony 
not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great leviathanwas suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock 
andto what 
to three bits of board 
is this the creature of whom it wasonce so triumphantly said  canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons or his head with fish spears 
the sword of him that layeth at himcannot hold  the spear  the dart  nor the habergeon  he esteemeth ironas straw  the arrow cannot make him flee  darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spear   this the creature 
this he 
oh that unfulfilments should follow the prophets 
for with the strength ofa thousand thighs in his tail  leviathan had run his head under themountains of the sea  to hide him from the pequod s fish spears in that sloping afternoon sunlight  the shadows that the three boatssent down beneath the surface  must have been long enough and broadenough to shade half xerxes  army 
who can tell how appalling to thewounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head  stand by  men  he stirs   cried starbuck  as the three lines suddenlyvibrated in the water  distinctly conducting upwards to them  as bymagnetic wires  the life and death throbs of the whale  so that everyoarsman felt them in his seat 
the next moment  relieved in great partfrom the downward strain at the bows  the boats gave a sudden bounceupwards  as a small icefield will  when a dense herd of white bears arescared from it into the sea  haul in 
haul in   cried starbuck again   he s rising  the lines  of which  hardly an instant before  not one hand s breadthcould have been gained  were now in long quick coils flung back alldripping into the boats  and soon the whale broke water within twoship s lengths of the hunters his motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion 
in most landanimals there are certain valves or flood gates in many of their veins whereby when wounded  the blood is in some degree at least instantlyshut off in certain directions 
not so with the whale  one of whosepeculiarities it is to have an entire non valvular structure of theblood vessels  so that when pierced even by so small a point as aharpoon  a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterialsystem  and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure ofwater at a great distance below the surface  his life may be said topour from him in incessant streams 
yet so vast is the quantity ofblood in him  and so distant and numerous its interior fountains  thathe will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period  evenas in a drought a river will flow  whose source is in the well springsof far off and undiscernible hills 
even now  when the boats pulledupon this whale  and perilously drew over his swaying flukes  and thelances were darted into him  they were followed by steady jets from thenew made wound  which kept continually playing  while the naturalspout hole in his head was only at intervals  however rapid  sendingits affrighted moisture into the air 
from this last vent no blood yetcame  because no vital part of him had thus far been struck 
his life as they significantly call it  was untouched as the boats now more closely surrounded him  the whole upper part ofhis form  with much of it that is ordinarily submerged  was plainlyrevealed 
his eyes  or rather the places where his eyes had been  werebeheld 
as strange misgrown masses gather in the knot holes of thenoblest oaks when prostrate  so from the points which the whale s eyeshad once occupied  now protruded blind bulbs  horribly pitiable to see but pity there was none 
for all his old age  and his one arm  and hisblind eyes  he must die the death and be murdered  in order to lightthe gay bridals and other merry makings of men  and also to illuminatethe solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all toall 
still rolling in his blood  at last he partially disclosed astrangely discoloured bunch or protuberance  the size of a bushel  lowdown on the flank  a nice spot   cried flask   just let me prick him there once   avast   cried starbuck   there s no need of that  but humane starbuck was too late 
at the instant of the dart anulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound  and goaded by it into morethan sufferable anguish  the whale now spouting thick blood  with swiftfury blindly darted at the craft  bespattering them and their gloryingcrews all over with showers of gore  capsizing flask s boat and marringthe bows 
it was his death stroke 
for  by this time  so spent was heby loss of blood  that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he hadmade  lay panting on his side  impotently flapped with his stumped fin then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world  turned up thewhite secrets of his belly  lay like a log  and died 
it was mostpiteous  that last expiring spout 
as when by unseen hands the water isgradually drawn off from some mighty fountain  and with half stifledmelancholy gurglings the spray column lowers and lowers to theground so the last long dying spout of the whale soon  while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship  the bodyshowed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled immediately  by starbuck s orders  lines were secured to it atdifferent points  so that ere long every boat was a buoy  the sunkenwhale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords 
by veryheedful management  when the ship drew nigh  the whale was transferredto her side  and was strongly secured there by the stiffestfluke chains  for it was plain that unless artificially upheld  thebody would at once sink to the bottom it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in hisflesh  on the lower part of the bunch before described 
but as thestumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of capturedwhales  with the flesh perfectly healed around them  and no prominenceof any kind to denote their place  therefore  there must needs havebeen some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account forthe ulceration alluded to 
but still more curious was the fact of alance head of stone being found in him  not far from the buried iron the flesh perfectly firm about it 
who had darted that stone lance 
it might have been darted by some nor  west indian long beforeamerica was discovered what other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrouscabinet there is no telling 
but a sudden stop was put to furtherdiscoveries  by the ship s being unprecedentedly dragged over sidewaysto the sea  owing to the body s immensely increasing tendency to sink however  starbuck  who had the ordering of affairs  hung on to it tothe last  hung on to it so resolutely  indeed  that when at length theship would have been capsized  if still persisting in locking arms withthe body  then  when the command was given to break clear from it  suchwas the immovable strain upon the timber heads to which thefluke chains and cables were fastened  that it was impossible to castthem off 
meantime everything in the pequod was aslant 
to cross to theother side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of ahouse 
the ship groaned and gasped 
many of the ivory inlayings of herbulwarks and cabins were started from their places  by the unnaturaldislocation 
in vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon theimmovable fluke chains  to pry them adrift from the timberheads  and solow had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be atall approached  while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemedadded to the sinking bulk  and the ship seemed on the point of goingover  hold on  hold on  won t ye   cried stubb to the body   don t be insuch a devil of a hurry to sink 
by thunder  men  we must do somethingor go for it 
no use prying there  avast  i say with your handspikes and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen knife  and cut the bigchains   knife 
aye  aye   cried queequeg  and seizing the carpenter s heavyhatchet  he leaned out of a porthole  and steel to iron  began slashingat the largest fluke chains 
but a few strokes  full of sparks  weregiven  when the exceeding strain effected the rest 
with a terrificsnap  every fastening went adrift  the ship righted  the carcase sank now  this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed spermwhale is a very curious thing  nor has any fisherman yet adequatelyaccounted for it 
usually the dead sperm whale floats with greatbuoyancy  with its side or belly considerably elevated above thesurface 
if the only whales that thus sank were old  meagre  andbroken hearted creatures  their pads of lard diminished and all theirbones heavy and rheumatic  then you might with some reason assert thatthis sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish sosinking  consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him 
but itis not so 
for young whales  in the highest health  and swelling withnoble aspirations  prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may oflife  with all their panting lard about them  even these brawny buoyant heroes do sometimes sink be it said  however  that the sperm whale is far less liable to thisaccident than any other species 
where one of that sort go down  twentyright whales do 
this difference in the species is no doubt imputablein no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton  from thisincumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free 
but there are instanceswhere  after the lapse of many hours or several days  the sunken whaleagain rises  more buoyant than in life 
but the reason of this isobvious 
gases are generated in him  he swells to a prodigiousmagnitude  becomes a sort of animal balloon 
a line of battle shipcould hardly keep him under then 
in the shore whaling  on soundings among the bays of new zealand  when a right whale gives token ofsinking  they fasten buoys to him  with plenty of rope  so that whenthe body has gone down  they know where to look for it when it shallhave ascended again it was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard fromthe pequod s mast heads  announcing that the jungfrau was againlowering her boats  though the only spout in sight was that of afin back  belonging to the species of uncapturable whales  because ofits incredible power of swimming 
nevertheless  the fin back s spout isso similar to the sperm whale s  that by unskilful fishermen it isoften mistaken for it 
and consequently derick and all his host werenow in valiant chase of this unnearable brute 
the virgin crowding allsail  made after her four young keels  and thus they all disappearedfar to leeward  still in bold  hopeful chase oh 
many are the fin backs  and many are the dericks  my friend chapter 82 
the honor and glory of whaling there are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is thetrue method the more i dive into this matter of whaling  and push my researches upto the very spring head of it so much the more am i impressed with itsgreat honorableness and antiquity  and especially when i find so manygreat demi gods and heroes  prophets of all sorts  who one way or otherhave shed distinction upon it  i am transported with the reflectionthat i myself belong  though but subordinately  to so emblazoned afraternity the gallant perseus  a son of jupiter  was the first whaleman  and tothe eternal honor of our calling be it said  that the first whaleattacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent those were the knightly days of our profession  when we only bore armsto succor the distressed  and not to fill men s lamp feeders 
every oneknows the fine story of perseus and andromeda  how the lovelyandromeda  the daughter of a king  was tied to a rock on the sea coast and as leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off  perseus  theprince of whalemen  intrepidly advancing  harpooned the monster  anddelivered and married the maid 
it was an admirable artistic exploit rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day  inasmuch asthis leviathan was slain at the very first dart 
and let no man doubtthis arkite story  for in the ancient joppa  now jaffa  on the syriancoast  in one of the pagan temples  there stood for many ages the vastskeleton of a whale  which the city s legends and all the inhabitantsasserted to be the identical bones of the monster that perseus slew when the romans took joppa  the same skeleton was carried to italy intriumph 
what seems most singular and suggestively important in thisstory  is this  it was from joppa that jonah set sail akin to the adventure of perseus and andromeda indeed  by some supposedto be indirectly derived from it is that famous story of st  george andthe dragon  which dragon i maintain to have been a whale  for in manyold chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together  andoften stand for each other 
 thou art as a lion of the waters  and as adragon of the sea   saith ezekiel  hereby  plainly meaning a whale  intruth  some versions of the bible use that word itself 
besides  itwould much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st  george butencountered a crawling reptile of the land  instead of doing battlewith the great monster of the deep 
any man may kill a snake  but onlya perseus  a st  george  a coffin  have the heart in them to marchboldly up to a whale let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us  for though thecreature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguelyrepresented of a griffin like shape  and though the battle is depictedon land and the saint on horseback  yet considering the great ignoranceof those times  when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists and considering that as in perseus  case  st  george s whale might havecrawled up out of the sea on the beach  and considering that the animalridden by st  george might have been only a large seal  or sea horse bearing all this in mind  it will not appear altogether incompatiblewith the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene  tohold this so called dragon no other than the great leviathan himself in fact  placed before the strict and piercing truth  this whole storywill fare like that fish  flesh  and fowl idol of the philistines dagon by name  who being planted before the ark of israel  his horse shead and both the palms of his hands fell off from him  and only thestump or fishy part of him remained 
thus  then  one of our own noblestamp  even a whaleman  is the tutelary guardian of england  and bygood rights  we harpooneers of nantucket should be enrolled in the mostnoble order of st  george 
and therefore  let not the knights of thathonorable company  none of whom  i venture to say  have ever had to dowith a whale like their great patron   let them never eye a nantucketerwith disdain  since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers weare much better entitled to st  george s decoration than they whether to admit hercules among us or not  concerning this i longremained dubious  for though according to the greek mythologies  thatantique crockett and kit carson that brawny doer of rejoicing gooddeeds  was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale  still  whether thatstrictly makes a whaleman of him  that might be mooted 
it nowhereappears that he ever actually harpooned his fish  unless  indeed  fromthe inside 
nevertheless  he may be deemed a sort of involuntarywhaleman  at any rate the whale caught him  if he did not the whale 
iclaim him for one of our clan but  by the best contradictory authorities  this grecian story ofhercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still moreancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale  and vice versâ  certainlythey are very similar 
if i claim the demi god then  why not theprophet nor do heroes  saints  demigods  and prophets alone comprise the wholeroll of our order 
our grand master is still to be named  for likeroyal kings of old times  we find the head waters of our fraternity innothing short of the great gods themselves 
that wondrous orientalstory is now to be rehearsed from the shaster  which gives us the dreadvishnoo  one of the three persons in the godhead of the hindoos  givesus this divine vishnoo himself for our lord  vishnoo  who  by the firstof his ten earthly incarnations  has for ever set apart and sanctifiedthe whale 
when brahma  or the god of gods  saith the shaster  resolvedto recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions  he gavebirth to vishnoo  to preside over the work  but the vedas  or mysticalbooks  whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoobefore beginning the creation  and which therefore must have containedsomething in the shape of practical hints to young architects  thesevedas were lying at the bottom of the waters  so vishnoo becameincarnate in a whale  and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths rescued the sacred volumes 
was not this vishnoo a whaleman  then 
evenas a man who rides a horse is called a horseman perseus  st  george  hercules  jonah  and vishnoo 
there s amember roll for you 
what club but the whaleman s can head off likethat chapter 83 
jonah historically regarded reference was made to the historical story of jonah and the whale inthe preceding chapter 
now some nantucketers rather distrust thishistorical story of jonah and the whale 
but then there were somesceptical greeks and romans  who  standing out from the orthodox pagansof their times  equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale and arion and the dolphin  and yet their doubting those traditions didnot make those traditions one whit the less facts  for all that one old sag harbor whaleman s chief reason for questioning the hebrewstory was this  he had one of those quaint old fashioned bibles embellished with curious  unscientific plates  one of which representedjonah s whale with two spouts in his head a peculiarity only true withrespect to a species of the leviathan  the right whale  and thevarieties of that order   concerning which the fishermen have thissaying   a penny roll would choke him   his swallow is so very small but  to this  bishop jebb s anticipative answer is ready 
it is notnecessary  hints the bishop  that we consider jonah as tombed in thewhale s belly  but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth 
andthis seems reasonable enough in the good bishop 
for truly  the rightwhale s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist tables  andcomfortably seat all the players 
possibly  too  jonah might haveensconced himself in a hollow tooth  but  on second thoughts  the rightwhale is toothless another reason which sag harbor  he went by that name  urged for hiswant of faith in this matter of the prophet  was something obscurely inreference to his incarcerated body and the whale s gastric juices 
butthis objection likewise falls to the ground  because a german exegetistsupposes that jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of adead whale even as the french soldiers in the russian campaign turnedtheir dead horses into tents  and crawled into them 
besides  it hasbeen divined by other continental commentators  that when jonah wasthrown overboard from the joppa ship  he straightway effected hisescape to another vessel near by  some vessel with a whale for afigure head  and  i would add  possibly called  the whale   as somecraft are nowadays christened the  shark   the  gull   the  eagle   norhave there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that thewhale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meant a life preserver aninflated bag of wind which the endangered prophet swam to  and so wassaved from a watery doom 
poor sag harbor  therefore  seems worsted allround 
but he had still another reason for his want of faith 
it wasthis  if i remember right  jonah was swallowed by the whale in themediterranean sea  and after three days he was vomited up somewherewithin three days  journey of nineveh  a city on the tigris  very muchmore than three days  journey across from the nearest point of themediterranean coast 
how is that but was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet withinthat short distance of nineveh 
he might have carried him round bythe way of the cape of good hope 
but not to speak of the passagethrough the whole length of the mediterranean  and another passage upthe persian gulf and red sea  such a supposition would involve thecomplete circumnavigation of all africa in three days  not to speak ofthe tigris waters  near the site of nineveh  being too shallow for anywhale to swim in 
besides  this idea of jonah s weathering the cape ofgood hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery ofthat great headland from bartholomew diaz  its reputed discoverer  andso make modern history a liar but all these foolish arguments of old sag harbor only evinced hisfoolish pride of reason a thing still more reprehensible in him  seeingthat he had but little learning except what he had picked up from thesun and the sea 
i say it only shows his foolish  impious pride  andabominable  devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy 
for by aportuguese catholic priest  this very idea of jonah s going to ninevehvia the cape of good hope was advanced as a signal magnification of thegeneral miracle 
and so it was 
besides  to this day  the highlyenlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah and some three centuries ago  an english traveller in old harris svoyages  speaks of a turkish mosque built in honor of jonah  in whichmosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil chapter 84 
pitchpoling to make them run easily and swiftly  the axles of carriages areanointed  and for much the same purpose  some whalers perform ananalogous operation upon their boat  they grease the bottom 
nor is itto be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm  it may possiblybe of no contemptible advantage  considering that oil and water arehostile  that oil is a sliding thing  and that the object in view is tomake the boat slide bravely 
queequeg believed strongly in anointinghis boat  and one morning not long after the german ship jungfraudisappeared  took more than customary pains in that occupation crawling under its bottom  where it hung over the side  and rubbing inthe unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hairfrom the craft s bald keel 
he seemed to be working in obedience tosome particular presentiment 
nor did it remain unwarranted by theevent towards noon whales were raised  but so soon as the ship sailed down tothem  they turned and fled with swift precipitancy  a disorderedflight  as of cleopatra s barges from actium nevertheless  the boats pursued  and stubb s was foremost 
by greatexertion  tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron  but thestricken whale  without at all sounding  still continued his horizontalflight  with added fleetness 
such unintermitted strainings upon theplanted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it 
it becameimperative to lance the flying whale  or be content to lose him 
but tohaul the boat up to his flank was impossible  he swam so fast andfurious 
what then remained of all the wondrous devices and dexterities  the sleights of hand andcountless subtleties  to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced none exceed that fine manœuvre with the lance called pitchpoling 
smallsword  or broad sword  in all its exercises boasts nothing like it 
itis only indispensable with an inveterate running whale  its grand factand feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance isaccurately darted from a violently rocking  jerking boat  under extremeheadway 
steel and wood included  the entire spear is some ten ortwelve feet in length  the staff is much slighter than that of theharpoon  and also of a lighter material pine 
it is furnished with asmall rope called a warp  of considerable length  by which it can behauled back to the hand after darting but before going further  it is important to mention here  that thoughthe harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance  yet it isseldom done  and when done  is still less frequently successful  onaccount of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon ascompared with the lance  which in effect become serious drawbacks 
as ageneral thing  therefore  you must first get fast to a whale  beforeany pitchpoling comes into play look now at stubb  a man who from his humorous  deliberate coolness andequanimity in the direst emergencies  was specially qualified to excelin pitchpoling 
look at him  he stands upright in the tossed bow of theflying boat  wrapt in fleecy foam  the towing whale is forty feetahead 
handling the long lance lightly  glancing twice or thrice alongits length to see if it be exactly straight  stubb whistlingly gathersup the coil of the warp in one hand  so as to secure its free end inhis grasp  leaving the rest unobstructed 
then holding the lance fullbefore his waistband s middle  he levels it at the whale  when covering him with it  he steadily depresses the butt end in his hand thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced uponhis palm  fifteen feet in the air 
he minds you somewhat of a juggler balancing a long staff on his chin 
next moment with a rapid  namelessimpulse  in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foamingdistance  and quivers in the life spot of the whale 
instead ofsparkling water  he now spouts red blood  that drove the spigot out of him   cried stubb 
  tis july s immortalfourth  all fountains must run wine today 
would now  it were oldorleans whiskey  or old ohio  or unspeakable old monongahela 
then tashtego  lad  i d have ye hold a canakin to the jet  and we d drinkround it 
yea  verily  hearts alive  we d brew choice punch in thespread of his spout hole there  and from that live punch bowl quaff theliving stuff  again and again to such gamesome talk  the dexterous dart is repeated the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilfulleash 
the agonized whale goes into his flurry  the tow line isslackened  and the pitchpoler dropping astern  folds his hands  andmutely watches the monster die chapter 85 
the fountain that for six thousand years and no one knows how many millions of agesbefore the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea  andsprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep  as with so manysprinkling or mistifying pots  and that for some centuries back thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of thewhale  watching these sprinklings and spoutings that all this shouldbe  and yet  that down to this blessed minute  fifteen and a quarterminutes past one o clock p m  of this sixteenth day of december  a d 1851   it should still remain a problem  whether these spoutings are after all  really water  or nothing but vapor this is surely anoteworthy thing let us  then  look at this matter  along with some interesting itemscontingent 
every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of theirgills  the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all timesis combined with the element in which they swim  hence  a herring or acod might live a century  and never once raise its head above thesurface 
but owing to his marked internal structure which gives himregular lungs  like a human being s  the whale can only live byinhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere 
wherefore thenecessity for his periodical visits to the upper world 
but he cannotin any degree breathe through his mouth  for  in his ordinary attitude the sperm whale s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath thesurface  and what is still more  his windpipe has no connexion with hismouth 
no  he breathes through his spiracle alone  and this is on thetop of his head if i say  that in any creature breathing is only a functionindispensable to vitality  inasmuch as it withdraws from the air acertain element  which being subsequently brought into contact with theblood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle  i do not think ishall err  though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific words assume it  and it follows that if all the blood in a man could beaerated with one breath  he might then seal up his nostrils and notfetch another for a considerable time 
that is to say  he would thenlive without breathing 
anomalous as it may seem  this is precisely thecase with the whale  who systematically lives  by intervals  his fullhour and more  when at the bottom  without drawing a single breath  orso much as in any way inhaling a particle of air  for  remember  he hasno gills 
how is this 
between his ribs and on each side of his spinehe is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth ofvermicelli like vessels  which vessels  when he quits the surface  arecompletely distended with oxygenated blood 
so that for an hour ormore  a thousand fathoms in the sea  he carries a surplus stock ofvitality in him  just as the camel crossing the waterless desertcarries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its foursupplementary stomachs 
the anatomical fact of this labyrinth isindisputable  and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonableand true  seems the more cogent to me  when i consider the otherwiseinexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out as the fishermen phrase it 
this is what i mean 
if unmolested  uponrising to the surface  the sperm whale will continue there for a periodof time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings 
say hestays eleven minutes  and jets seventy times  that is  respires seventybreaths  then whenever he rises again  he will be sure to have hisseventy breaths over again  to a minute 
now  if after he fetches a fewbreaths you alarm him  so that he sounds  he will be always dodging upagain to make good his regular allowance of air 
and not till thoseseventy breaths are told  will he finally go down to stay out his fullterm below 
remark  however  that in different individuals these ratesare different  but in any one they are alike 
now  why should the whalethus insist upon having his spoutings out  unless it be to replenishhis reservoir of air  ere descending for good 
how obvious is it  too that this necessity for the whale s rising exposes him to all the fatalhazards of the chase 
for not by hook or by net could this vastleviathan be caught  when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath thesunlight 
not so much thy skill  then  o hunter  as the greatnecessities that strike the victory to thee in man  breathing is incessantly going on one breath only serving fortwo or three pulsations  so that whatever other business he has toattend to  waking or sleeping  breathe he must  or die he will 
but thesperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time it has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout hole if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water then i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense ofsmell seems obliterated in him  for the only thing about him that atall answers to his nose is that identical spout hole  and being soclogged with two elements  it could not be expected to have the powerof smelling 
but owing to the mystery of the spout whether it be wateror whether it be vapor no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived aton this head 
sure it is  nevertheless  that the sperm whale has noproper olfactories 
but what does he want of them 
no roses  noviolets  no cologne water in the sea furthermore  as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spoutingcanal  and as that long canal like the grand erie canal is furnishedwith a sort of locks  that open and shut  for the downward retention ofair or the upward exclusion of water  therefore the whale has no voice unless you insult him by saying  that when he so strangely rumbles  hetalks through his nose 
but then again  what has the whale to say seldom have i known any profound being that had anything to say to thisworld  unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting aliving 
happy that the world is such an excellent listener now  the spouting canal of the sperm whale  chiefly intended as it isfor the conveyance of air  and for several feet laid along horizontally  just beneath the upper surface of his head  and a littleto one side  this curious canal is very much like a gas pipe laid downin a city on one side of a street 
but the question returns whetherthis gas pipe is also a water pipe  in other words  whether the spoutof the sperm whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath  or whetherthat exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth  anddischarged through the spiracle 
it is certain that the mouthindirectly communicates with the spouting canal  but it cannot beproved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through thespiracle 
because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be when in feeding he accidentally takes in water 
but the sperm whale sfood is far beneath the surface  and there he cannot spout even if hewould 
besides  if you regard him very closely  and time him with yourwatch  you will find that when unmolested  there is an undeviatingrhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods ofrespiration but why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject 
speak out you have seen him spout  then declare what the spout is  can you nottell water from air 
my dear sir  in this world it is not so easy tosettle these plain things 
i have ever found your plain things theknottiest of all 
and as for this whale spout  you might almost standin it  and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely the central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist envelopingit  and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it when  always  when you are close enough to a whale to get a close viewof his spout  he is in a prodigious commotion  the water cascading allaround him 
and if at such times you should think that you reallyperceived drops of moisture in the spout  how do you know that they arenot merely condensed from its vapor  or how do you know that they arenot those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout holefissure  which is countersunk into the summit of the whale s head 
foreven when tranquilly swimming through the mid day sea in a calm  withhis elevated hump sun dried as a dromedary s in the desert  even then the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head  as under ablazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up withrain nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching theprecise nature of the whale spout 
it will not do for him to be peeringinto it  and putting his face in it 
you cannot go with your pitcher tothis fountain and fill it  and bring it away 
for even when coming intoslight contact with the outer  vapory shreds of the jet  which willoften happen  your skin will feverishly smart  from the acridness ofthe thing so touching it 
and i know one  who coming into still closercontact with the spout  whether with some scientific object in view  orotherwise  i cannot say  the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm wherefore  among whalemen  the spout is deemed poisonous  they try toevade it 
another thing  i have heard it said  and i do not much doubtit  that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes  it will blindyou 
the wisest thing the investigator can do then  it seems to me  isto let this deadly spout alone still  we can hypothesize  even if we cannot prove and establish 
myhypothesis is this  that the spout is nothing but mist 
and besidesother reasons  to this conclusion i am impelled  by considerationstouching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale  iaccount him no common  shallow being  inasmuch as it is an undisputedfact that he is never found on soundings  or near shores  all otherwhales sometimes are 
he is both ponderous and profound 
and i amconvinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings  such asplato  pyrrho  the devil  jupiter  dante  and so on  there always goesup a certain semi visible steam  while in the act of thinking deepthoughts 
while composing a little treatise on eternity  i had thecuriosity to place a mirror before me  and ere long saw reflectedthere  a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere overmy head 
the invariable moisture of my hair  while plunged in deepthought  after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic  of anaugust noon  this seems an additional argument for the abovesupposition and how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty  misty monster  tobehold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea  his vast  mildhead overhung by a canopy of vapor  engendered by his incommunicablecontemplations  and that vapor as you will sometimes see it glorifiedby a rainbow  as if heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts for  d ye see  rainbows do not visit the clear air  they only irradiatevapor 
and so  through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in mymind  divine intuitions now and then shoot  enkindling my fog with aheavenly ray 
and for this i thank god  for all have doubts  many deny but doubts or denials  few along with them  have intuitions 
doubts ofall things earthly  and intuitions of some things heavenly  thiscombination makes neither believer nor infidel  but makes a man whoregards them both with equal eye chapter 86 
the tail other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights  less celestial i celebrate a tail reckoning the largest sized sperm whale s tail to begin at that pointof the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man  it comprisesupon its upper surface alone  an area of at least fifty square feet the compact round body of its root expands into two broad  firm  flatpalms or flukes  gradually shoaling away to less than an inch inthickness 
at the crotch or junction  these flukes slightly overlap then sideways recede from each other like wings  leaving a wide vacancybetween 
in no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitelydefined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes 
at its utmostexpansion in the full grown whale  the tail will considerably exceedtwenty feet across the entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews  but cutinto it  and you find that three distinct strata compose it  upper middle  and lower 
the fibres in the upper and lower layers  are longand horizontal  those of the middle one  very short  and runningcrosswise between the outside layers 
this triune structure  as much asanything else  imparts power to the tail 
to the student of old romanwalls  the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thincourse of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderfulrelics of the antique  and which undoubtedly contribute so much to thegreat strength of the masonry but as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof ofmuscular fibres and filaments  which passing on either side the loinsand running down into the flukes  insensibly blend with them  andlargely contribute to their might  so that in the tail the confluentmeasureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point could annihilation occur to matter  this were the thing to do it nor does this its amazing strength  at all tend to cripple the gracefulflexion of its motions  where infantileness of ease undulates through atitanism of power 
on the contrary  those motions derive their mostappalling beauty from it 
real strength never impairs beauty orharmony  but it often bestows it  and in everything imposinglybeautiful  strength has much to do with the magic 
take away the tiedtendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carvedhercules  and its charm would be gone 
as devout eckerman lifted thelinen sheet from the naked corpse of goethe  he was overwhelmed withthe massive chest of the man  that seemed as a roman triumphal arch when angelo paints even god the father in human form  mark whatrobustness is there 
and whatever they may reveal of the divine love inthe son  the soft  curled  hermaphroditical italian pictures  in whichhis idea has been most successfully embodied  these pictures  sodestitute as they are of all brawniness  hint nothing of any power  butthe mere negative  feminine one of submission and endurance  which onall hands it is conceded  form the peculiar practical virtues of histeachings such is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of  that whetherwielded in sport  or in earnest  or in anger  whatever be the mood itbe in  its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace 
thereinno fairy s arm can transcend it five great motions are peculiar to it 
first  when used as a fin forprogression  second  when used as a mace in battle  third  in sweeping fourth  in lobtailing  fifth  in peaking flukes first  being horizontal in its position  the leviathan s tail acts in adifferent manner from the tails of all other sea creatures 
it neverwriggles 
in man or fish  wriggling is a sign of inferiority 
to thewhale  his tail is the sole means of propulsion 
scroll wise coiledforwards beneath the body  and then rapidly sprung backwards  it isthis which gives that singular darting  leaping motion to the monsterwhen furiously swimming 
his side fins only serve to steer by second  it is a little significant  that while one sperm whale onlyfights another sperm whale with his head and jaw  nevertheless  in hisconflicts with man  he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail 
instriking at a boat  he swiftly curves away his flukes from it  and theblow is only inflicted by the recoil 
if it be made in the unobstructedair  especially if it descend to its mark  the stroke is then simplyirresistible 
no ribs of man or boat can withstand it 
your onlysalvation lies in eluding it  but if it comes sideways through theopposing water  then partly owing to the light buoyancy of thewhale boat  and the elasticity of its materials  a cracked rib or adashed plank or two  a sort of stitch in the side  is generally themost serious result 
these submerged side blows are so often receivedin the fishery  that they are accounted mere child s play 
some onestrips off a frock  and the hole is stopped third  i cannot demonstrate it  but it seems to me  that in the whalethe sense of touch is concentrated in the tail  for in this respectthere is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of theelephant s trunk 
this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action ofsweeping  when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain softslowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface ofthe sea  and if he feel but a sailor s whisker  woe to that sailor whiskers and all 
what tenderness there is in that preliminary touch had this tail any prehensile power  i should straightway bethink me ofdarmonodes  elephant that so frequented the flower market  and with lowsalutations presented nosegays to damsels  and then caressed theirzones 
on more accounts than one  a pity it is that the whale does notpossess this prehensile virtue in his tail  for i have heard of yetanother elephant  that when wounded in the fight  curved round histrunk and extracted the dart fourth  stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of themiddle of solitary seas  you find him unbent from the vast corpulenceof his dignity  and kitten like  he plays on the ocean as if it were ahearth 
but still you see his power in his play 
the broad palms of histail are flirted high into the air  then smiting the surface  thethunderous concussion resounds for miles 
you would almost think agreat gun had been discharged  and if you noticed the light wreath ofvapor from the spiracle at his other extremity  you would think thatthat was the smoke from the touch hole fifth  as in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukeslie considerably below the level of his back  they are then completelyout of sight beneath the surface  but when he is about to plunge intothe deeps  his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body aretossed erect in the air  and so remain vibrating a moment  till theydownwards shoot out of view 
excepting the sublime breach somewhereelse to be described this peaking of the whale s flukes is perhaps thegrandest sight to be seen in all animated nature 
out of the bottomlessprofundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at thehighest heaven 
so in dreams  have i seen majestic satan thrustingforth his tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell 
but ingazing at such scenes  it is all in all what mood you are in  if in thedantean  the devils will occur to you  if in that of isaiah  thearchangels 
standing at the mast head of my ship during a sunrise thatcrimsoned sky and sea  i once saw a large herd of whales in the east all heading towards the sun  and for a moment vibrating in concert withpeaked flukes 
as it seemed to me at the time  such a grand embodimentof adoration of the gods was never beheld  even in persia  the home ofthe fire worshippers 
as ptolemy philopater testified of the africanelephant  i then testified of the whale  pronouncing him the mostdevout of all beings 
for according to king juba  the militaryelephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunksuplifted in the profoundest silence the chance comparison in this chapter  between the whale and theelephant  so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunkof the other are concerned  should not tend to place those two oppositeorgans on an equality  much less the creatures to which theyrespectively belong 
for as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier toleviathan  so  compared with leviathan s tail  his trunk is but thestalk of a lily 
the most direful blow from the elephant s trunk wereas the playful tap of a fan  compared with the measureless crush andcrash of the sperm whale s ponderous flukes  which in repeatedinstances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all theiroars and crews into the air  very much as an indian juggler tosses hisballs 
  though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale andthe elephant is preposterous  inasmuch as in that particular theelephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog doesto the elephant  nevertheless  there are not wanting some points ofcurious similitude  among these is the spout 
it is well known that theelephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk  and thenelevating it  jet it forth in a stream the more i consider this mighty tail  the more do i deplore myinability to express it 
at times there are gestures in it  which though they would well grace the hand of man  remain whollyinexplicable 
in an extensive herd  so remarkable  occasionally  arethese mystic gestures  that i have heard hunters who have declared themakin to free mason signs and symbols  that the whale  indeed  by thesemethods intelligently conversed with the world 
nor are there wantingother motions of the whale in his general body  full of strangeness and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant 
dissect him how imay  then  i but go skin deep  i know him not  and never will 
but if iknow not even the tail of this whale  how understand his head 
muchmore  how comprehend his face  when face he has none 
thou shalt see myback parts  my tail  he seems to say  but my face shall not be seen but i cannot completely make out his back parts  and hint what he willabout his face  i say again he has no face chapter 87

by the straits of sunda  chiefly vessels bound to china from the west  emerge into the china seas those narrow straits of sunda divide sumatra from java  and standingmidway in that vast rampart of islands  buttressed by that bold greenpromontory  known to seamen as java head  they not a little correspondto the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire  andconsidering the inexhaustible wealth of spices  and silks  and jewels and gold  and ivory  with which the thousand islands of that orientalsea are enriched  it seems a significant provision of nature  that suchtreasures  by the very formation of the land  should at least bear theappearance  however ineffectual  of being guarded from the all graspingwestern world 
the shores of the straits of sunda are unsupplied withthose domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to themediterranean  the baltic  and the propontis 
unlike the danes  theseorientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top sails fromthe endless procession of ships before the wind  which for centuriespast  by night and by day  have passed between the islands of sumatraand java  freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east 
but whilethey freely waive a ceremonial like this  they do by no means renouncetheir claim to more solid tribute time out of mind the piratical proas of the malays  lurking among thelow shaded coves and islets of sumatra  have sallied out upon thevessels sailing through the straits  fiercely demanding tribute at thepoint of their spears 
though by the repeated bloody chastisements theyhave received at the hands of european cruisers  the audacity of thesecorsairs has of late been somewhat repressed  yet  even at the presentday  we occasionally hear of english and american vessels  which  inthose waters  have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged with a fair  fresh wind  the pequod was now drawing nigh to thesestraits  ahab purposing to pass through them into the javan sea  andthence  cruising northwards  over waters known to be frequented hereand there by the sperm whale  sweep inshore by the philippine islands and gain the far coast of japan  in time for the great whaling seasonthere 
by these means  the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almostall the known sperm whale cruising grounds of the world  previous todescending upon the line in the pacific  where ahab  though everywhereelse foiled in his pursuit  firmly counted upon giving battle to mobydick  in the sea he was most known to frequent  and at a season when hemight most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it but how now 
in this zoned quest  does ahab touch no land 
does hiscrew drink air 
surely  he will stop for water 
for a long time now  the circus running sun has raced within his fiery ring  and needsno sustenance but what s in himself 
so ahab 
mark this  too  in thewhaler 
while other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff  to betransferred to foreign wharves  the world wandering whale ship carriesno cargo but herself and crew  their weapons and their wants 
she has awhole lake s contents bottled in her ample hold 
she is ballasted withutilities  not altogether with unusable pig lead and kentledge 
shecarries years  water in her 
clear old prime nantucket water  which when three years afloat  the nantucketer  in the pacific  prefers todrink before the brackish fluid  but yesterday rafted off in casks from the peruvian or indian streams 
hence it is  that  while otherships may have gone to china from new york  and back again  touching ata score of ports  the whale ship  in all that interval  may not havesighted one grain of soil  her crew having seen no man but floatingseamen like themselves 
so that did you carry them the news thatanother flood had come  they would only answer  well  boys  here s theark  now  as many sperm whales had been captured off the western coast ofjava  in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda  indeed  as most ofthe ground  roundabout  was generally recognised by the fishermen as anexcellent spot for cruising  therefore  as the pequod gained more andmore upon java head  the look outs were repeatedly hailed  andadmonished to keep wide awake 
but though the green palmy cliffs of theland soon loomed on the starboard bow  and with delighted nostrils thefresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air  yet not a single jet wasdescried 
almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any gamehereabouts  the ship had well nigh entered the straits  when thecustomary cheering cry was heard from aloft  and ere long a spectacleof singular magnificence saluted us but here be it premised  that owing to the unwearied activity withwhich of late they have been hunted over all four oceans  the spermwhales  instead of almost invariably sailing in small detachedcompanies  as in former times  are now frequently met with in extensiveherds  sometimes embracing so great a multitude  that it would almostseem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league andcovenant for mutual assistance and protection 
to this aggregation ofthe sperm whale into such immense caravans  may be imputed thecircumstance that even in the best cruising grounds  you may nowsometimes sail for weeks and months together  without being greeted bya single spout  and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seemsthousands on thousands broad on both bows  at the distance of some two or three miles  andforming a great semicircle  embracing one half of the level horizon  acontinuous chain of whale jets were up playing and sparkling in thenoon day air 
unlike the straight perpendicular twin jets of the rightwhale  which  dividing at top  fall over in two branches  like thecleft drooping boughs of a willow  the single forward slanting spout ofthe sperm whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist  continuallyrising and falling away to leeward seen from the pequod s deck  then  as she would rise on a high hill ofthe sea  this host of vapory spouts  individually curling up into theair  and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze  showedlike the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis  descriedof a balmy autumnal morning  by some horseman on a height as marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains accelerate their march  all eagerness to place that perilous passage intheir rear  and once more expand in comparative security upon theplain  even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forwardthrough the straits  gradually contracting the wings of theirsemicircle  and swimming on  in one solid  but still crescentic centre crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them  the harpooneershandling their weapons  and loudly cheering from the heads of their yetsuspended boats 
if the wind only held  little doubt had they  thatchased through these straits of sunda  the vast host would only deployinto the oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of theirnumber 
and who could tell whether  in that congregated caravan  mobydick himself might not temporarily be swimming  like the worshippedwhite elephant in the coronation procession of the siamese 
so withstun sail piled on stun sail  we sailed along  driving these leviathansbefore us  when  of a sudden  the voice of tashtego was heard  loudlydirecting attention to something in our wake corresponding to the crescent in our van  we beheld another in ourrear 
it seemed formed of detached white vapors  rising and fallingsomething like the spouts of the whales  only they did not socompletely come and go  for they constantly hovered  without finallydisappearing 
levelling his glass at this sight  ahab quickly revolvedin his pivot hole  crying   aloft there  and rig whips and buckets towet the sails  malays  sir  and after us  as if too long lurking behind the headlands  till the pequod shouldfairly have entered the straits  these rascally asiatics were now inhot pursuit  to make up for their over cautious delay 
but when theswift pequod  with a fresh leading wind  was herself in hot chase  howvery kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her onto her own chosen pursuit  mere riding whips and rowels to her  thatthey were 
as with glass under arm  ahab to and fro paced the deck  inhis forward turn beholding the monsters he chased  and in the after onethe bloodthirsty pirates chasing him  some such fancy as the aboveseemed his 
and when he glanced upon the green walls of the waterydefile in which the ship was then sailing  and bethought him thatthrough that gate lay the route to his vengeance  and beheld  how thatthrough that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to hisdeadly end  and not only that  but a herd of remorseless wild piratesand inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on withtheir curses  when all these conceits had passed through his brain ahab s brow was left gaunt and ribbed  like the black sand beach aftersome stormy tide has been gnawing it  without being able to drag thefirm thing from its place but thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew  andwhen  after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern  thepequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatraside  emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond  then  theharpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had beengaining upon the ship  than to rejoice that the ship had sovictoriously gained upon the malays 
but still driving on in the wakeof the whales  at length they seemed abating their speed  gradually theship neared them  and the wind now dying away  word was passed tospring to the boats 
but no sooner did the herd  by some presumedwonderful instinct of the sperm whale  become notified of the threekeels that were after them  though as yet a mile in their rear  thanthey rallied again  and forming in close ranks and battalions  so thattheir spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets  movedon with redoubled velocity stripped to our shirts and drawers  we sprang to the white ash  andafter several hours  pulling were almost disposed to renounce thechase  when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animatingtoken that they were now at last under the influence of that strangeperplexity of inert irresolution  which  when the fishermen perceive itin the whale  they say he is gallied 
the compact martial columns inwhich they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming  were nowbroken up in one measureless rout  and like king porus  elephants inthe indian battle with alexander  they seemed going mad withconsternation 
in all directions expanding in vast irregular circles and aimlessly swimming hither and thither  by their short thickspoutings  they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic 
this wasstill more strangely evinced by those of their number  who  completelyparalysed as it were  helplessly floated like water logged dismantledships on the sea 
had these leviathans been but a flock of simplesheep  pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves  they could notpossibly have evinced such excessive dismay 
but this occasionaltimidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures 
thoughbanding together in tens of thousands  the lion maned buffaloes of thewest have fled before a solitary horseman 
witness  too  all humanbeings  how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre s pit they will  at the slightest alarm of fire  rush helter skelter for theoutlets  crowding  trampling  jamming  and remorselessly dashing eachother to death 
best  therefore  withhold any amazement at thestrangely gallied whales before us  for there is no folly of the beastsof the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men though many of the whales  as has been said  were in violent motion yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced norretreated  but collectively remained in one place 
as is customary inthose cases  the boats at once separated  each making for some one lonewhale on the outskirts of the shoal 
in about three minutes  time queequeg s harpoon was flung  the stricken fish darted blinding sprayin our faces  and then running away with us like light  steeredstraight for the heart of the herd 
though such a movement on the partof the whale struck under such circumstances  is in no wiseunprecedented  and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of thefishery 
for as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into thefrantic shoal  you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in adelirious throb as  blind and deaf  the whale plunged forward  as if by sheer power ofspeed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him  as wethus tore a white gash in the sea  on all sides menaced as we flew  bythe crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us  our beset boat waslike a ship mobbed by ice isles in a tempest  and striving to steerthrough their complicated channels and straits  knowing not at whatmoment it may be locked in and crushed but not a bit daunted  queequeg steered us manfully  now sheering offfrom this monster directly across our route in advance  now edging awayfrom that  whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead  while all thetime  starbuck stood up in the bows  lance in hand  pricking out of ourway whatever whales he could reach by short darts  for there was notime to make long ones 
nor were the oarsmen quite idle  though theirwonted duty was now altogether dispensed with 
they chiefly attended tothe shouting part of the business 
 out of the way  commodore   criedone  to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface and for an instant threatened to swamp us 
 hard down with your tail there   cried a second to another  which  close to our gunwale  seemedcalmly cooling himself with his own fan like extremity all whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances  originally inventedby the nantucket indians  called druggs 
two thick squares of wood ofequal size are stoutly clenched together  so that they cross eachother s grain at right angles  a line of considerable length is thenattached to the middle of this block  and the other end of the linebeing looped  it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon 
it ischiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used 
for then  morewhales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time 
butsperm whales are not every day encountered  while you may  then  youmust kill all you can 
and if you cannot kill them all at once  youmust wing them  so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure hence it is  that at times like these the drugg  comes intorequisition 
our boat was furnished with three of them 
the first andsecond were successfully darted  and we saw the whales staggeringlyrunning off  fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towingdrugg 
they were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball 
butupon flinging the third  in the act of tossing overboard the clumsywooden block  it caught under one of the seats of the boat  and in aninstant tore it out and carried it away  dropping the oarsman in theboat s bottom as the seat slid from under him 
on both sides the seacame in at the wounded planks  but we stuffed two or three drawers andshirts in  and so stopped the leaks for the time it had been next to impossible to dart these drugged harpoons  were itnot that as we advanced into the herd  our whale s way greatlydiminished  moreover  that as we went still further and further fromthe circumference of commotion  the direful disorders seemed waning 
sothat when at last the jerking harpoon drew out  and the towing whalesideways vanished  then  with the tapering force of his partingmomentum  we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of theshoal  as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serenevalley lake 
here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermostwhales  were heard but not felt 
in this central expanse the seapresented that smooth satin like surface  called a sleek  produced bythe subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods yes  we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at theheart of every commotion 
and still in the distracted distance webeheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles  and saw successivepods of whales  eight or ten in each  swiftly going round and round like multiplied spans of horses in a ring  and so closely shoulder toshoulder  that a titanic circus rider might easily have over arched themiddle ones  and so have gone round on their backs 
owing to thedensity of the crowd of reposing whales  more immediately surroundingthe embayed axis of the herd  no possible chance of escape was atpresent afforded us 
we must watch for a breach in the living wall thathemmed us in  the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut usup 
keeping at the centre of the lake  we were occasionally visited bysmall tame cows and calves  the women and children of this routed host now  inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolvingouter circles  and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods inany one of those circles  the entire area at this juncture  embraced bythe whole multitude  must have contained at least two or three squaremiles 
at any rate though indeed such a test at such a time might bedeceptive spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemedplaying up almost from the rim of the horizon 
i mention thiscircumstance  because  as if the cows and calves had been purposelylocked up in this innermost fold  and as if the wide extent of the herdhad hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of itsstopping  or  possibly  being so young  unsophisticated  and every wayinnocent and inexperienced  however it may have been  these smallerwhales now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of thelake evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence  or else a stillbecharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at 
likehousehold dogs they came snuffling round us  right up to our gunwales and touching them  till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenlydomesticated them 
queequeg patted their foreheads  starbuck scratchedtheir backs with his lance  but fearful of the consequences  for thetime refrained from darting it but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface  another and stillstranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side 
for  suspendedin those watery vaults  floated the forms of the nursing mothers of thewhales  and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to becomemothers 
the lake  as i have hinted  was to a considerable depthexceedingly transparent  and as human infants while suckling willcalmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast  as if leading twodifferent lives at the time  and while yet drawing mortal nourishment be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence  even sodid the young of these whales seem looking up towards us  but not atus  as if we were but a bit of gulfweed in their new born sight floating on their sides  the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us 
oneof these little infants  that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly aday old  might have measured some fourteen feet in length  and some sixfeet in girth 
he was a little frisky  though as yet his body seemedscarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so latelyoccupied in the maternal reticule  where  tail to head  and all readyfor the final spring  the unborn whale lies bent like a tartar s bow the delicate side fins  and the palms of his flukes  still freshlyretained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby s ears newly arrivedfrom foreign parts  line 
line   cried queequeg  looking over the gunwale   him fast 
himfast  who line him 
who struck  two whale  one big  one little   what ails ye  man   cried starbuck  look e here   said queequeg  pointing down as when the stricken whale  that from the tub has reeled out hundredsof fathoms of rope  as  after deep sounding  he floats up again  andshows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spirallingtowards the air  so now  starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cordof madame leviathan  by which the young cub seemed still tethered toits dam 
not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase  thisnatural line  with the maternal end loose  becomes entangled with thehempen one  so that the cub is thereby trapped 
some of the subtlestsecrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond 
wesaw young leviathan amours in the deep 
  the sperm whale  as with all other species of the leviathan  butunlike most other fish  breeds indifferently at all seasons  after agestation which may probably be set down at nine months  producing butone at a time  though in some few known instances giving birth to anesau and jacob  a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats curiously situated  one on each side of the anus  but the breaststhemselves extend upwards from that 
when by chance these preciousparts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter s lance  the mother spouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods 
the milkis very sweet and rich  it has been tasted by man  it might do wellwith strawberries 
when overflowing with mutual esteem  the whalessalute more hominum and thus  though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations andaffrights  did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely andfearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments  yea  serenely revelledin dalliance and delight 
but even so  amid the tornadoed atlantic ofmy being  do i myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me  deep downand deep inland there i still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy meanwhile  as we thus lay entranced  the occasional sudden franticspectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host  orpossibly carrying on the war within the first circle  where abundanceof room and some convenient retreats were afforded them 
but the sightof the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and froacross the circles  was nothing to what at last met our eyes 
it issometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerfuland alert  to seek to hamstring him  as it were  by sundering ormaiming his gigantic tail tendon 
it is done by darting a short handledcutting spade  to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again 
awhale wounded  as we afterwards learned  in this part  but noteffectually  as it seemed  had broken away from the boat  carryingalong with him half of the harpoon line  and in the extraordinary agonyof the wound  he was now dashing among the revolving circles like thelone mounted desperado arnold  at the battle of saratoga  carryingdismay wherever he went but agonizing as was the wound of this whale  and an appallingspectacle enough  any way  yet the peculiar horror with which he seemedto inspire the rest of the herd  was owing to a cause which at firstthe intervening distance obscured from us 
but at length we perceivedthat by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery  this whalehad become entangled in the harpoon line that he towed  he had also runaway with the cutting spade in him  and while the free end of the ropeattached to that weapon  had permanently caught in the coils of theharpoon line round his tail  the cutting spade itself had worked loosefrom his flesh 
so that tormented to madness  he was now churningthrough the water  violently flailing with his flexible tail  andtossing the keen spade about him  wounding and murdering his owncomrades this terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from theirstationary fright 
first  the whales forming the margin of our lakebegan to crowd a little  and tumble against each other  as if lifted byhalf spent billows from afar  then the lake itself began faintly toheave and swell  the submarine bridal chambers and nurseries vanished in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more centralcircles began to swim in thickening clusters 
yes  the long calm wasdeparting 
a low advancing hum was soon heard  and then like to thetumultuous masses of block ice when the great river hudson breaks up inspring  the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their innercentre  as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain 
instantlystarbuck and queequeg changed places  starbuck taking the stern  oars 
oars   he intensely whispered  seizing the helm  gripe youroars  and clutch your souls  now 
my god  men  stand by 
shove him off you queequeg the whale there  prick him  hit him 
stand up stand up and stay so 
spring  men pull  men  never mind their backs scrapethem  scrape away  the boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks  leaving anarrow dardanelles between their long lengths 
but by desperateendeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening  then giving wayrapidly  and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet after many similar hair breadth escapes  we at last swiftly glided intowhat had just been one of the outer circles  but now crossed by randomwhales  all violently making for one centre 
this lucky salvation wascheaply purchased by the loss of queequeg s hat  who  while standing inthe bows to prick the fugitive whales  had his hat taken clean from hishead by the air eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broadflukes close by riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was  it soonresolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement  for havingclumped together at last in one dense body  they then renewed theironward flight with augmented fleetness 
further pursuit was useless but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what druggedwhales might be dropped astern  and likewise to secure one which flaskhad killed and waifed 
the waif is a pennoned pole  two or three ofwhich are carried by every boat  and which  when additional game is athand  are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale  bothto mark its place on the sea  and also as token of prior possession should the boats of any other ship draw near the result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacioussaying in the fishery  the more whales the less fish 
of all thedrugged whales only one was captured 
the rest contrived to escape forthe time  but only to be taken  as will hereafter be seen  by someother craft than the pequod chapter 88 
schools and schoolmasters the previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of spermwhales  and there was also then given the probable cause inducing thosevast aggregations now  though such great bodies are at times encountered  yet  as musthave been seen  even at the present day  small detached bands areoccasionally observed  embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each such bands are known as schools 
they generally are of two sorts  thosecomposed almost entirely of females  and those mustering none but youngvigorous males  or bulls  as they are familiarly designated in cavalier attendance upon the school of females  you invariably see amale of full grown magnitude  but not old  who  upon any alarm  evinceshis gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of hisladies 
in truth  this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman  swimming aboutover the watery world  surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces andendearments of the harem 
the contrast between this ottoman and hisconcubines is striking  because  while he is always of the largestleviathanic proportions  the ladies  even at full growth  are not morethan one third of the bulk of an average sized male 
they arecomparatively delicate  indeed  i dare say  not to exceed half a dozenyards round the waist 
nevertheless  it cannot be denied  that upon thewhole they are hereditarily entitled to en bon point it is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolentramblings 
like fashionables  they are for ever on the move inleisurely search of variety 
you meet them on the line in time for thefull flower of the equatorial feeding season  having just returned perhaps  from spending the summer in the northern seas  and so cheatingsummer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth 
by the time they havelounged up and down the promenade of the equator awhile  they start forthe oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there  and soevade the other excessive temperature of the year when serenely advancing on one of these journeys  if any strangesuspicious sights are seen  my lord whale keeps a wary eye on hisinteresting family 
should any unwarrantably pert young leviathancoming that way  presume to draw confidentially close to one of theladies  with what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him  and chaseshim away 
high times  indeed  if unprincipled young rakes like him areto be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss  though dowhat the bashaw will  he cannot keep the most notorious lothario out ofhis bed  for  alas 
all fish bed in common 
as ashore  the ladies oftencause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers  just so withthe whales  who sometimes come to deadly battle  and all for love 
theyfence with their long lower jaws  sometimes locking them together  andso striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave theirantlers 
not a few are captured having the deep scars of theseencounters  furrowed heads  broken teeth  scolloped fins  and in someinstances  wrenched and dislocated mouths but supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away atthe first rush of the harem s lord  then is it very diverting to watchthat lord 
gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again andrevels there awhile  still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario like pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines granting other whales to be in sight  the fishermen will seldom givechase to one of these grand turks  for these grand turks are too lavishof their strength  and hence their unctuousness is small 
as for thesons and the daughters they beget  why  those sons and daughters musttake care of themselves  at least  with only the maternal help 
forlike certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named  mylord whale has no taste for the nursery  however much for the bower and so  being a great traveller  he leaves his anonymous babies allover the world  every baby an exotic 
in good time  nevertheless  asthe ardour of youth declines  as years and dumps increase  asreflection lends her solemn pauses  in short  as a general lassitudeovertakes the sated turk  then a love of ease and virtue supplants thelove for maidens  our ottoman enters upon the impotent  repentant admonitory stage of life  forswears  disbands the harem  and grown toan exemplary  sulky old soul  goes about all alone among the meridiansand parallels saying his prayers  and warning each young leviathan fromhis amorous errors now  as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school  so isthe lord and master of that school technically known as theschoolmaster 
it is therefore not in strict character  howeveradmirably satirical  that after going to school himself  he should thengo abroad inculcating not what he learned there  but the folly of it his title  schoolmaster  would very naturally seem derived from thename bestowed upon the harem itself  but some have surmised that theman who first thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale  must have readthe memoirs of vidocq  and informed himself what sort of acountry schoolmaster that famous frenchman was in his younger days  andwhat was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some ofhis pupils the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whalebetakes himself in his advancing years  is true of all aged spermwhales 
almost universally  a lone whale as a solitary leviathan iscalled proves an ancient one 
like venerable moss bearded daniel boone he will have no one near him but nature herself  and her he takes towife in the wilderness of waters  and the best of wives she is  thoughshe keeps so many moody secrets the schools composing none but young and vigorous males  previouslymentioned  offer a strong contrast to the harem schools 
for whilethose female whales are characteristically timid  the young males  orforty barrel bulls  as they call them  are by far the most pugnaciousof all leviathans  and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter excepting those wondrous grey headed  grizzled whales  sometimes met and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout the forty barrel bull schools are larger than the harem schools 
like amob of young collegians  they are full of fight  fun  and wickedness tumbling round the world at such a reckless  rollicking rate  that noprudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotouslad at yale or harvard 
they soon relinquish this turbulence though and when about three fourths grown  break up  and separately go aboutin quest of settlements  that is  harems another point of difference between the male and female schools isstill more characteristic of the sexes 
say you strike aforty barrel bull poor devil 
all his comrades quit him 
but strike amember of the harem school  and her companions swim around her withevery token of concern  sometimes lingering so near her and so long  asthemselves to fall a prey chapter 89 
fast fish and loose fish the allusion to the waif and waif poles in the last chapter but one necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whalefishery  of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge it frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company a whale may be struck by one vessel  then escape  and be finally killedand captured by another vessel  and herein are indirectly comprisedmany minor contingencies  all partaking of this one grand feature 
forexample  after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale  thebody may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm  anddrifting far away to leeward  be retaken by a second whaler  who  in acalm  snugly tows it alongside  without risk of life or line 
thus themost vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between thefishermen  were there not some written or unwritten  universal undisputed law applicable to all cases perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislativeenactment  was that of holland 
it was decreed by the states general ina d 
but though no other nation has ever had any written whalinglaw  yet the american fishermen have been their own legislators andlawyers in this matter 
they have provided a system which for tersecomprehensiveness surpasses justinian s pandects and the by laws of thechinese society for the suppression of meddling with other people sbusiness 
yes  these laws might be engraven on a queen anne s farthing or the barb of a harpoon  and worn round the neck  so small are they i 
a fast fish belongs to the party fast to it ii 
a loose fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it but what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirablebrevity of it  which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries toexpound it first  what is a fast fish 
alive or dead a fish is technically fast when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat  by any medium atall controllable by the occupant or occupants  a mast  an oar  anine inch cable  a telegraph wire  or a strand of cobweb  it is all thesame 
likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif  or anyother recognised symbol of possession  so long as the party waifing itplainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside  as wellas their intention so to do these are scientific commentaries  but the commentaries of the whalementhemselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks thecoke upon littleton of the fist 
true  among the more upright andhonorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases  whereit would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claimpossession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party 
butothers are by no means so scrupulous some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale trover litigatedin england  wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase ofa whale in the northern seas  and when indeed they  the plaintiffs  hadsucceeded in harpooning the fish  they were at last  through peril oftheir lives  obliged to forsake not only their lines  but their boatitself 
ultimately the defendants  the crew of another ship  came upwith the whale  struck  killed  seized  and finally appropriated itbefore the very eyes of the plaintiffs 
and when those defendants wereremonstrated with  their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs teeth  and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he haddone  he would now retain their line  harpoons  and boat  which hadremained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure 
whereforethe plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale line  harpoons  and boat mr 
erskine was counsel for the defendants  lord ellenborough was thejudge 
in the course of the defence  the witty erskine went on toillustrate his position  by alluding to a recent crim 
case wherein a gentleman  after in vain trying to bridle his wife sviciousness  had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life  but inthe course of years  repenting of that step  he instituted an action torecover possession of her 
erskine was on the other side  and he thensupported it by saying  that though the gentleman had originallyharpooned the lady  and had once had her fast  and only by reason ofthe great stress of her plunging viciousness  had at last abandonedher  yet abandon her he did  so that she became a loose fish  andtherefore when a subsequent gentleman re harpooned her  the lady thenbecame that subsequent gentleman s property  along with whateverharpoon might have been found sticking in her now in the present case erskine contended that the examples of thewhale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other these pleadings  and the counter pleadings  being duly heard  the verylearned judge in set terms decided  to wit  that as for the boat  heawarded it to the plaintiffs  because they had merely abandoned it tosave their lives  but that with regard to the controverted whale harpoons  and line  they belonged to the defendants  the whale  becauseit was a loose fish at the time of the final capture  and the harpoonsand line because when the fish made off with them  it  the fish acquired a property in those articles  and hence anybody who afterwardstook the fish had a right to them 
now the defendants afterwards tookthe fish  ergo  the aforesaid articles were theirs a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge  mightpossibly object to it 
but ploughed up to the primary rock of thematter  the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling lawspreviously quoted  and applied and elucidated by lord ellenborough inthe above cited case  these two laws touching fast fish and loose fish i say  will  on reflection  be found the fundamentals of all humanjurisprudence  for notwithstanding its complicated tracery ofsculpture  the temple of the law  like the temple of the philistines has but two props to stand on is it not a saying in every one s mouth  possession is half of the law that is  regardless of how the thing came into possession 
but oftenpossession is the whole of the law 
what are the sinews and souls ofrussian serfs and republican slaves but fast fish  whereof possessionis the whole of the law 
what to the rapacious landlord is the widow slast mite but a fast fish 
what is yonder undetected villain s marblemansion with a door plate for a waif  what is that but a fast fish what is the ruinous discount which mordecai  the broker  gets from poorwoebegone  the bankrupt  on a loan to keep woebegone s family fromstarvation  what is that ruinous discount but a fast fish 
what is thearchbishop of savesoul s income of  100 000 seized from the scant breadand cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken backed laborers  all sureof heaven without any of savesoul s help  what is that globular 100 000 but a fast fish 
what are the duke of dunder s hereditarytowns and hamlets but fast fish 
what to that redoubted harpooneer john bull  is poor ireland  but a fast fish 
what to that apostoliclancer  brother jonathan  is texas but a fast fish 
and concerning allthese  is not possession the whole of the law but if the doctrine of fast fish be pretty generally applicable  thekindred doctrine of loose fish is still more widely so 
that isinternationally and universally applicable what was america in 1492 but a loose fish  in which columbus struck thespanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master andmistress

heads or tails  de balena vero sufficit  si rex habeat caput  et regina caudam  bracton  l  3  c  3 latin from the books of the laws of england  which taken along with thecontext  means  that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast ofthat land  the king  as honorary grand harpooneer  must have the head and the queen be respectfully presented with the tail 
a divisionwhich  in the whale  is much like halving an apple  there is nointermediate remainder 
now as this law  under a modified form  is tothis day in force in england  and as it offers in various respects astrange anomaly touching the general law of fast and loose fish  it ishere treated of in a separate chapter  on the same courteous principlethat prompts the english railways to be at the expense of a separatecar  specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty 
in the firstplace  in curious proof of the fact that the above mentioned law isstill in force  i proceed to lay before you a circumstance thathappened within the last two years it seems that some honest mariners of dover  or sandwich  or some oneof the cinque ports  had after a hard chase succeeded in killing andbeaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off fromthe shore 
now the cinque ports are partially or somehow under thejurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle  called a lord warden holding the office directly from the crown  i believe  all the royalemoluments incident to the cinque port territories become by assignmenthis 
by some writers this office is called a sinecure 
but not so because the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbing hisperquisites  which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing ofthem now when these poor sun burnt mariners  bare footed  and with theirtrowsers rolled high up on their eely legs  had wearily hauled theirfat fish high and dry  promising themselves a good  150 from theprecious oil and bone  and in fantasy sipping rare tea with theirwives  and good ale with their cronies  upon the strength of theirrespective shares  up steps a very learned and most christian andcharitable gentleman  with a copy of blackstone under his arm  andlaying it upon the whale s head  he says  hands off 
this fish  mymasters  is a fast fish 
i seize it as the lord warden s   upon thisthe poor mariners in their respectful consternation so trulyenglish knowing not what to say  fall to vigorously scratching theirheads all round  meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to thestranger 
but that did in nowise mend the matter  or at all soften thehard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of blackstone 
atlength one of them  after long scratching about for his ideas  madebold to speak  please  sir  who is the lord warden   the duke   but the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish   it is his   we have been at great trouble  and peril  and some expense  and is allthat to go to the duke s benefit  we getting nothing at all for ourpains but our blisters   it is his   is the duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode ofgetting a livelihood   it is his   i thought to relieve my old bed ridden mother by part of my share ofthis whale   it is his   won t the duke be content with a quarter or a half   it is his  in a word  the whale was seized and sold  and his grace the duke ofwellington received the money 
thinking that viewed in some particularlights  the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree bedeemed  under the circumstances  a rather hard one  an honest clergymanof the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace  begging him totake the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration 
towhich my lord duke in substance replied  both letters were published that he had already done so  and received the money  and would beobliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he  the reverendgentleman  would decline meddling with other people s business 
is thisthe still militant old man  standing at the corners of the threekingdoms  on all hands coercing alms of beggars it will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the duketo the whale was a delegated one from the sovereign 
we must needsinquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally investedwith that right 
the law itself has already been set forth 
but plowdongives us the reason for it 
says plowdon  the whale so caught belongsto the king and queen   because of its superior excellence   and by thesoundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in suchmatters but why should the king have the head  and the queen the tail 
a reasonfor that  ye lawyers in his treatise on  queen gold   or queen pinmoney  an old king s benchauthor  one william prynne  thus discourseth   ye tail is ye queen s that ye queen s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone   now thiswas written at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland orright whale was largely used in ladies  bodices 
but this same bone isnot in the tail  it is in the head  which is a sad mistake for asagacious lawyer like prynne 
but is the queen a mermaid  to bepresented with a tail 
an allegorical meaning may lurk here there are two royal fish so styled by the english law writers the whaleand the sturgeon  both royal property under certain limitations  andnominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown s ordinary revenue 
iknow not that any other author has hinted of the matter  but byinference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the sameway as the whale  the king receiving the highly dense and elastic headpeculiar to that fish  which  symbolically regarded  may possibly behumorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality 
and thus thereseems a reason in all things  even in law chapter 91 
the pequod meets the rose bud  in vain it was to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of thisleviathan  insufferable fetor denying not inquiry   sir t  browne v e it was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted  and whenwe were slowly sailing over a sleepy  vapory  mid day sea  that themany noses on the pequod s deck proved more vigilant discoverers thanthe three pairs of eyes aloft 
a peculiar and not very pleasant smellwas smelt in the sea  i will bet something now   said stubb   that somewhere hereabouts aresome of those drugged whales we tickled the other day 
i thought theywould keel up before long  presently  the vapors in advance slid aside  and there in the distancelay a ship  whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale mustbe alongside 
as we glided nearer  the stranger showed french coloursfrom his peak  and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea fowl thatcircled  and hovered  and swooped around him  it was plain that thewhale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale  thatis  a whale that has died unmolested on the sea  and so floated anunappropriated corpse 
it may well be conceived  what an unsavory odorsuch a mass must exhale  worse than an assyrian city in the plague when the living are incompetent to bury the departed 
so intolerableindeed is it regarded by some  that no cupidity could persuade them tomoor alongside of it 
yet are there those who will still do it notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is ofa very inferior quality  and by no means of the nature ofattar of rose coming still nearer with the expiring breeze  we saw that the frenchmanhad a second whale alongside  and this second whale seemed even more ofa nosegay than the first 
in truth  it turned out to be one of thoseproblematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort ofprodigious dyspepsia  or indigestion  leaving their defunct bodiesalmost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil 
nevertheless  in theproper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn uphis nose at such a whale as this  however much he may shun blastedwhales in general the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger  that stubb vowed herecognised his cutting spade pole entangled in the lines that wereknotted round the tail of one of these whales  there s a pretty fellow  now   he banteringly laughed  standing in theship s bows   there s a jackal for ye 
i well know that these crappoesof frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery  sometimes loweringtheir boats for breakers  mistaking them for sperm whale spouts  yes and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes oftallow candles  and cases of snuffers  foreseeing that all the oil theywill get won t be enough to dip the captain s wick into  aye  we allknow these things  but look ye  here s a crappo that is content withour leavings  the drugged whale there  i mean  aye  and is content toowith scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there poor devil 
i say  pass round a hat  some one  and let s make him apresent of a little oil for dear charity s sake 
for what oil he ll getfrom that drugged whale there  wouldn t be fit to burn in a jail  no not in a condemned cell 
and as for the other whale  why  i ll agree toget more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours than he ll get from that bundle of bones  though  now that i think ofit  it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil  yes ambergris 
i wonder now if our old man has thought of that 
it s worthtrying 
yes  i m for it   and so saying he started for thequarter deck by this time the faint air had become a complete calm  so that whetheror no  the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell  with no hopeof escaping except by its breezing up again 
issuing from the cabin stubb now called his boat s crew  and pulled off for the stranger drawing across her bow  he perceived that in accordance with thefanciful french taste  the upper part of her stem piece was carved inthe likeness of a huge drooping stalk  was painted green  and forthorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there  the wholeterminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour 
uponher head boards  in large gilt letters  he read  bouton derose   rose button  or rose bud  and this was the romantic name of thisaromatic ship though stubb did not understand the bouton part of the inscription yet the word rose  and the bulbous figure head put together sufficiently explained the whole to him  a wooden rose bud  eh   he cried with his hand to his nose   that willdo very well  but how like all creation it smells  now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck  hehad to pull round the bows to the starboard side  and thus come closeto the blasted whale  and so talk over it arrived then at this spot  with one hand still to his nose  hebawled  bouton de rose  ahoy 
are there any of you bouton de roses thatspeak english   yes   rejoined a guernsey man from the bulwarks  who turned out to bethe chief mate  well  then  my bouton de rose bud  have you seen the white whale   what whale   the white whale a sperm whale moby dick  have ye seen him  never heard of such a whale 
cachalot blanche 
white whale no   very good  then  good bye now  and i ll call again in a minute  then rapidly pulling back towards the pequod  and seeing ahab leaningover the quarter deck rail awaiting his report  he moulded his twohands into a trumpet and shouted  no  sir 
no   upon which ahabretired  and stubb returned to the frenchman he now perceived that the guernsey man  who had just got into thechains  and was using a cutting spade  had slung his nose in a sort ofbag  what s the matter with your nose  there   said stubb 
 broke it   i wish it was broken  or that i didn t have any nose at all   answeredthe guernsey man  who did not seem to relish the job he was at verymuch 
 but what are you holding yours for   oh  nothing 
it s a wax nose  i have to hold it on 
fine day  ain tit 
air rather gardenny  i should say  throw us a bunch of posies  willye  bouton de rose   what in the devil s name do you want here   roared the guernseyman flying into a sudden passion  oh 
keep cool cool 
yes  that s the word 
why don t you pack thosewhales in ice while you re working at  em 
but joking aside  though  doyou know  rose bud  that it s all nonsense trying to get any oil out ofsuch whales 
as for that dried up one  there  he hasn t a gill in hiswhole carcase   i know that well enough  but  d ye see  the captain here won t believeit  this is his first voyage  he was a cologne manufacturer before 
butcome aboard  and mayhap he ll believe you  if he won t me  and so i llget out of this dirty scrape   anything to oblige ye  my sweet and pleasant fellow   rejoined stubb and with that he soon mounted to the deck 
there a queer scenepresented itself 
the sailors  in tasselled caps of red worsted  weregetting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales 
but they workedrather slow and talked very fast  and seemed in anything but a goodhumor 
all their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so manyjib booms 
now and then pairs of them would drop their work  and run upto the mast head to get some fresh air 
some thinking they would catchthe plague  dipped oakum in coal tar  and at intervals held it to theirnostrils 
others having broken the stems of their pipes almost shortoff at the bowl  were vigorously puffing tobacco smoke  so that itconstantly filled their olfactories stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding fromthe captain s round house abaft  and looking in that direction saw afiery face thrust from behind the door  which was held ajar fromwithin 
this was the tormented surgeon  who  after in vainremonstrating against the proceedings of the day  had betaken himselfto the captain s round house  cabinet he called it  to avoid thepest  but still  could not help yelling out his entreaties andindignations at times marking all this  stubb argued well for his scheme  and turning to theguernsey man had a little chat with him  during which the stranger mateexpressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus  whohad brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle sounding him carefully  stubb further perceived that the guernsey manhad not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris 
he thereforeheld his peace on that head  but otherwise was quite frank andconfidential with him  so that the two quickly concocted a little planfor both circumventing and satirizing the captain  without his at alldreaming of distrusting their sincerity 
according to this little planof theirs  the guernsey man  under cover of an interpreter s office was to tell the captain what he pleased  but as coming from stubb  andas for stubb  he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermostin him during the interview by this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin 
he was asmall and dark  but rather delicate looking man for a sea captain  withlarge whiskers and moustache  however  and wore a red cotton velvetvest with watch seals at his side 
to this gentleman  stubb was nowpolitely introduced by the guernsey man  who at once ostentatiously puton the aspect of interpreting between them  what shall i say to him first   said he  why   said stubb  eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals   youmay as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me though i don t pretend to be a judge   he says  monsieur   said the guernsey man  in french  turning to hiscaptain   that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel  whose captainand chief mate  with six sailors  had all died of a fever caught from ablasted whale they had brought alongside  upon this the captain started  and eagerly desired to know more  what now   said the guernsey man to stubb  why  since he takes it so easy  tell him that now i have eyed himcarefully  i m quite certain that he s no more fit to command awhale ship than a st  jago monkey 
in fact  tell him from me he s ababoon   he vows and declares  monsieur  that the other whale  the dried one is far more deadly than the blasted one  in fine  monsieur  he conjuresus  as we value our lives  to cut loose from these fish  instantly the captain ran forward  and in a loud voice commanded hiscrew to desist from hoisting the cutting tackles  and at once castloose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship  what now   said the guernsey man  when the captain had returned tothem  why  let me see  yes  you may as well tell him now that that in fact tell him i ve diddled him  and  aside to himself  perhaps somebodyelse   he says  monsieur  that he s very happy to have been of any service tous  hearing this  the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties meaning himself and mate  and concluded by inviting stubb down intohis cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux  he wants you to take a glass of wine with him   said the interpreter  thank him heartily  but tell him it s against my principles to drinkwith the man i ve diddled 
in fact  tell him i must go   he says  monsieur  that his principles won t admit of his drinking but that if monsieur wants to live another day to drink  then monsieurhad best drop all four boats  and pull the ship away from these whales for it s so calm they won t drift  by this time stubb was over the side  and getting into his boat  hailedthe guernsey man to this effect  that having a long tow line in hisboat  he would do what he could to help them  by pulling out thelighter whale of the two from the ship s side 
while the frenchman sboats  then  were engaged in towing the ship one way  stubbbenevolently towed away at his whale the other way  ostentatiouslyslacking out a most unusually long tow line presently a breeze sprang up  stubb feigned to cast off from the whale hoisting his boats  the frenchman soon increased his distance  whilethe pequod slid in between him and stubb s whale 
whereupon stubbquickly pulled to the floating body  and hailing the pequod to givenotice of his intentions  at once proceeded to reap the fruit of hisunrighteous cunning 
seizing his sharp boat spade  he commenced anexcavation in the body  a little behind the side fin 
you would almosthave thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea  and when atlength his spade struck against the gaunt ribs  it was like turning upold roman tiles and pottery buried in fat english loam 
his boat s crewwere all in high excitement  eagerly helping their chief  and lookingas anxious as gold hunters and all the time numberless fowls were diving  and ducking  andscreaming  and yelling  and fighting around them 
stubb was beginningto look disappointed  especially as the horrible nosegay increased when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague  there stole afaint stream of perfume  which flowed through the tide of bad smellswithout being absorbed by it  as one river will flow into and thenalong with another  without at all blending with it for a time  i have it  i have it   cried stubb  with delight  striking somethingin the subterranean regions   a purse 
a purse  dropping his spade  he thrust both hands in  and drew out handfuls ofsomething that looked like ripe windsor soap  or rich mottled oldcheese  very unctuous and savory withal 
you might easily dent it withyour thumb  it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour 
and this good friends  is ambergris  worth a gold guinea an ounce to anydruggist 
some six handfuls were obtained  but more was unavoidablylost in the sea  and still more  perhaps  might have been secured wereit not for impatient ahab s loud command to stubb to desist  and comeon board  else the ship would bid them good bye chapter 92 
ambergris now this ambergris is a very curious substance  and so important as anarticle of commerce  that in 1791 a certain nantucket born captaincoffin was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on thatsubject 
for at that time  and indeed until a comparatively late day the precise origin of ambergris remained  like amber itself  a problemto the learned 
though the word ambergris is but the french compoundfor grey amber  yet the two substances are quite distinct 
for amber though at times found on the sea coast  is also dug up in some farinland soils  whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea besides  amber is a hard  transparent  brittle  odorless substance used for mouth pieces to pipes  for beads and ornaments  but ambergrisis soft  waxy  and so highly fragrant and spicy  that it is largelyused in perfumery  in pastiles  precious candles  hair powders  andpomatum 
the turks use it in cooking  and also carry it to mecca  forthe same purpose that frankincense is carried to st  peter s in rome some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret  to flavor it who would think  then  that such fine ladies and gentlemen shouldregale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of asick whale 
yet so it is 
by some  ambergris is supposed to be thecause  and by others the effect  of the dyspepsia in the whale 
how tocure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say  unless by administeringthree or four boat loads of brandreth s pills  and then running out ofharm s way  as laborers do in blasting rocks i have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris certain hard  round  bony plates  which at first stubb thought might besailors  trowsers buttons  but it afterwards turned out that they werenothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should befound in the heart of such decay  is this nothing 
bethink thee of thatsaying of st  paul in corinthians  about corruption and incorruption how that we are sown in dishonor  but raised in glory 
and likewisecall to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh thebest musk 
also forget not the strange fact that of all things ofill savor  cologne water  in its rudimental manufacturing stages  isthe worst i should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal  butcannot  owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made againstwhalemen  and which  in the estimation of some already biased minds might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been saidof the frenchman s two whales 
elsewhere in this volume the slanderousaspersion has been disproved  that the vocation of whaling isthroughout a slatternly  untidy business 
but there is another thing torebut 
they hint that all whales always smell bad 
now how did thisodious stigma originate i opine  that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of thegreenland whaling ships in london  more than two centuries ago 
becausethose whalemen did not then  and do not now  try out their oil at seaas the southern ships have always done  but cutting up the freshblubber in small bits  thrust it through the bung holes of large casks and carry it home in that manner  the shortness of the season in thoseicy seas  and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed forbidding any other course 
the consequence is  that upon breakinginto the hold  and unloading one of these whale cemeteries  in thegreenland dock  a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arisingfrom excavating an old city grave yard  for the foundations of alying in hospital i partly surmise also  that this wicked charge against whalers may belikewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland  in formertimes  of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg  whichlatter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack  in his greatwork on smells  a text book on that subject 
as its name imports smeer  fat  berg  to put up   this village was founded in order toafford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be triedout  without being taken home to holland for that purpose 
it was acollection of furnaces  fat kettles  and oil sheds  and when the workswere in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor 
butall this is quite different with a south sea sperm whaler  which in avoyage of four years perhaps  after completely filling her hold withoil  does not  perhaps  consume fifty days in the business of boilingout  and in the state that it is casked  the oil is nearly scentless the truth is  that living or dead  if but decently treated  whales as aspecies are by no means creatures of ill odor  nor can whalemen berecognised  as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a jewin the company  by the nose 
nor indeed can the whale possibly beotherwise than fragrant  when  as a general thing  he enjoys such highhealth  taking abundance of exercise  always out of doors  though  itis true  seldom in the open air 
i say  that the motion of a spermwhale s flukes above water dispenses a perfume  as when a musk scentedlady rustles her dress in a warm parlor 
what then shall i liken thesperm whale to for fragrance  considering his magnitude 
must it not beto that famous elephant  with jewelled tusks  and redolent with myrrh which was led out of an indian town to do honor to alexander the great chapter 93 
the castaway it was but some few days after encountering the frenchman  that a mostsignificant event befell the most insignificant of the pequod s crew an event most lamentable  and which ended in providing the sometimesmadly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanyingprophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own now  in the whale ship  it is not every one that goes in the boats some few hands are reserved called ship keepers  whose province it isto work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale 
as a generalthing  these ship keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprisingthe boats  crews 
but if there happen to be an unduly slender  clumsy or timorous wight in the ship  that wight is certain to be made aship keeper 
it was so in the pequod with the little negro pippin bynick name  pip by abbreviation 
poor pip 
ye have heard of him before ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight  sogloomy jolly in outer aspect  pip and dough boy made a match  like a black pony anda white one  of equal developments  though of dissimilar colour  drivenin one eccentric span 
but while hapless dough boy was by nature dulland torpid in his intellects  pip  though over tender hearted  was atbottom very bright  with that pleasant  genial  jolly brightnesspeculiar to his tribe  a tribe  which ever enjoy all holidays andfestivities with finer  freer relish than any other race 
for blacks the year s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty fivefourth of julys and new year s days 
nor smile so  while i write thatthis little black was brilliant  for even blackness has its brilliancy behold yon lustrous ebony  panelled in king s cabinets 
but pip lovedlife  and all life s peaceable securities  so that the panic strikingbusiness in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped  hadmost sadly blurred his brightness  though  as ere long will be seen what was thus temporarily subdued in him  in the end was destined to beluridly illumined by strange wild fires  that fictitiously showed himoff to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native tollandcounty in connecticut  he had once enlivened many a fiddler s frolic onthe green  and at melodious even tide  with his gay ha ha 
had turnedthe round horizon into one star belled tambourine 
so  though in theclear air of day  suspended against a blue veined neck  thepure watered diamond drop will healthful glow  yet  when the cunningjeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre  helays it against a gloomy ground  and then lights it up  not by the sun but by some unnatural gases 
then come out those fiery effulgences infernally superb  then the evil blazing diamond  once the divinestsymbol of the crystal skies  looks like some crown jewel stolen fromthe king of hell 
but let us to the story it came to pass  that in the ambergris affair stubb s after oarsmanchanced so to sprain his hand  as for a time to become quite maimed and  temporarily  pip was put into his place the first time stubb lowered with him  pip evinced much nervousness but happily  for that time  escaped close contact with the whale  andtherefore came off not altogether discreditably  though stubb observinghim  took care  afterwards  to exhort him to cherish his courageousnessto the utmost  for he might often find it needful now upon the second lowering  the boat paddled upon the whale  and asthe fish received the darted iron  it gave its customary rap  whichhappened  in this instance  to be right under poor pip s seat 
theinvoluntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap  paddle inhand  out of the boat  and in such a way  that part of the slack whaleline coming against his chest  he breasted it overboard with him  so asto become entangled in it  when at last plumping into the water 
thatinstant the stricken whale started on a fierce run  the line swiftlystraightened  and presto 
poor pip came all foaming up to the chocks ofthe boat  remorselessly dragged there by the line  which had takenseveral turns around his chest and neck tashtego stood in the bows 
he was full of the fire of the hunt 
hehated pip for a poltroon 
snatching the boat knife from its sheath  hesuspended its sharp edge over the line  and turning towards stubb exclaimed interrogatively   cut   meantime pip s blue  choked faceplainly looked  do  for god s sake 
all passed in a flash 
in less thanhalf a minute  this entire thing happened  damn him  cut   roared stubb  and so the whale was lost and pip wassaved so soon as he recovered himself  the poor little negro was assailed byyells and execrations from the crew 
tranquilly permitting theseirregular cursings to evaporate  stubb then in a plain  business like but still half humorous manner  cursed pip officially  and that done unofficially gave him much wholesome advice 
the substance was  neverjump from a boat  pip  except but all the rest was indefinite  as thesoundest advice ever is 
now  in general  stick to the boat  is yourtrue motto in whaling  but cases will sometimes happen when leap fromthe boat  is still better 
moreover  as if perceiving at last that ifhe should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip  he would beleaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future  stubb suddenlydropped all advice  and concluded with a peremptory command   stick tothe boat  pip  or by the lord  i won t pick you up if you jump  mindthat 
we can t afford to lose whales by the likes of you  a whale wouldsell for thirty times what you would  pip  in alabama 
bear that inmind  and don t jump any more   hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted that though man loved his fellow  yet man is a money making animal which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence but we are all in the hands of the gods  and pip jumped again 
it wasunder very similar circumstances to the first performance  but thistime he did not breast out the line  and hence  when the whale startedto run  pip was left behind on the sea  like a hurried traveller strunk 
stubb was but too true to his word 
it was a beautiful bounteous  blue day  the spangled sea calm and cool  and flatlystretching away  all round  to the horizon  like gold beater s skinhammered out to the extremest 
bobbing up and down in that sea  pip sebon head showed like a head of cloves 
no boat knife was lifted whenhe fell so rapidly astern 
stubb s inexorable back was turned upon him and the whale was winged 
in three minutes  a whole mile of shorelessocean was between pip and stubb 
out from the centre of the sea  poorpip turned his crisp  curling  black head to the sun  another lonelycastaway  though the loftiest and the brightest now  in calm weather  to swim in the open ocean is as easy to thepractised swimmer as to ride in a spring carriage ashore 
but the awfullonesomeness is intolerable 
the intense concentration of self in themiddle of such a heartless immensity  my god 
who can tell it 
mark how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea mark how closelythey hug their ship and only coast along her sides but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate 
no he did not mean to  at least 
because there were two boats in his wake and he supposed  no doubt  that they would of course come up to pipvery quickly  and pick him up  though  indeed  such considerationstowards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity  is not alwaysmanifested by the hunters in all similar instances  and such instancesnot unfrequently occur  almost invariably in the fishery  a coward  socalled  is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar tomilitary navies and armies but it so happened  that those boats  without seeing pip  suddenlyspying whales close to them on one side  turned  and gave chase  andstubb s boat was now so far away  and he and all his crew so intentupon his fish  that pip s ringed horizon began to expand around himmiserably 
by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot  such at least  they said he was 
the sea had jeeringly kept his finite bodyup  but drowned the infinite of his soul 
not drowned entirely  though rather carried down alive to wondrous depths  where strange shapes ofthe unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes and the miser merman  wisdom  revealed his hoarded heaps  and among thejoyous  heartless  ever juvenile eternities  pip saw the multitudinous god omnipresent  coral insects  that out of the firmament of watersheaved the colossal orbs 
he saw god s foot upon the treadle of theloom  and spoke it  and therefore his shipmates called him mad 
soman s insanity is heaven s sense  and wandering from all mortal reason man comes at last to that celestial thought  which  to reason  isabsurd and frantic  and weal or woe  feels then uncompromised indifferent as his god for the rest  blame not stubb too hardly 
the thing is common in thatfishery  and in the sequel of the narrative  it will then be seen whatlike abandonment befell myself chapter 94 
a squeeze of the hand that whale of stubb s  so dearly purchased  was duly brought to thepequod s side  where all those cutting and hoisting operationspreviously detailed  were regularly gone through  even to the baling ofthe heidelburgh tun  or case while some were occupied with this latter duty  others were employed indragging away the larger tubs  so soon as filled with the sperm  andwhen the proper time arrived  this same sperm was carefully manipulatedere going to the try works  of which anon it had cooled and crystallized to such a degree  that when  withseveral others  i sat down before a large constantine s bath of it  ifound it strangely concreted into lumps  here and there rolling aboutin the liquid part 
it was our business to squeeze these lumps backinto fluid 
a sweet and unctuous duty 
no wonder that in old times thissperm was such a favourite cosmetic 
such a clearer 
such a sweetener such a softener 
such a delicious molifier 
after having my hands in itfor only a few minutes  my fingers felt like eels  and began  as itwere  to serpentine and spiralise as i sat there at my ease  cross legged on the deck  after the bitterexertion at the windlass  under a blue tranquil sky  the ship underindolent sail  and gliding so serenely along  as i bathed my handsamong those soft  gentle globules of infiltrated tissues  woven almostwithin the hour  as they richly broke to my fingers  and discharged alltheir opulence  like fully ripe grapes their wine  as i snuffed up thatuncontaminated aroma  literally and truly  like the smell of springviolets  i declare to you  that for the time i lived as in a muskymeadow  i forgot all about our horrible oath  in that inexpressiblesperm  i washed my hands and my heart of it  i almost began to creditthe old paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue inallaying the heat of anger  while bathing in that bath  i felt divinelyfree from all ill will  or petulance  or malice  of any sortwhatsoever squeeze 
all the morning long  i squeezed that spermtill i myself almost melted into it  i squeezed that sperm till astrange sort of insanity came over me  and i found myself unwittinglysqueezing my co laborers  hands in it  mistaking their hands for thegentle globules 
such an abounding  affectionate  friendly  lovingfeeling did this avocation beget  that at last i was continuallysqueezing their hands  and looking up into their eyes sentimentally  asmuch as to say  oh 
my dear fellow beings  why should we longer cherishany social acerbities  or know the slightest ill humor or envy 
come let us squeeze hands all round  nay  let us all squeeze ourselves intoeach other  let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk andsperm of kindness would that i could keep squeezing that sperm for ever 
for now  sinceby many prolonged  repeated experiences  i have perceived that in allcases man must eventually lower  or at least shift  his conceit ofattainable felicity  not placing it anywhere in the intellect or thefancy  but in the wife  the heart  the bed  the table  the saddle  thefireside  the country  now that i have perceived all this  i am readyto squeeze case eternally 
in thoughts of the visions of the night  isaw long rows of angels in paradise  each with his hands in a jar ofspermaceti now  while discoursing of sperm  it behooves to speak of other thingsakin to it  in the business of preparing the sperm whale for thetry works first comes white horse  so called  which is obtained from the taperingpart of the fish  and also from the thicker portions of his flukes 
itis tough with congealed tendons a wad of muscle but still contains someoil 
after being severed from the whale  the white horse is first cutinto portable oblongs ere going to the mincer 
they look much likeblocks of berkshire marble plum pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of thewhale s flesh  here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber  andoften participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness 
it isa most refreshing  convivial  beautiful object to behold 
as its nameimports  it is of an exceedingly rich  mottled tint  with a bestreakedsnowy and golden ground  dotted with spots of the deepest crimson andpurple 
it is plums of rubies  in pictures of citron 
spite of reason it is hard to keep yourself from eating it 
i confess  that once istole behind the foremast to try it 
it tasted something as i shouldconceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might havetasted  supposing him to have been killed the first day after thevenison season  and that particular venison season contemporary with anunusually fine vintage of the vineyards of champagne there is another substance  and a very singular one  which turns up inthe course of this business  but which i feel it to be very puzzlingadequately to describe 
it is called slobgollion  an appellationoriginal with the whalemen  and even so is the nature of the substance it is an ineffably oozy  stringy affair  most frequently found in thetubs of sperm  after a prolonged squeezing  and subsequent decanting 
ihold it to be the wondrously thin  ruptured membranes of the case coalescing gurry  so called  is a term properly belonging to right whalemen  butsometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen 
it designates thedark  glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of thegreenland or right whale  and much of which covers the decks of thoseinferior souls who hunt that ignoble leviathan nippers 
strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale svocabulary 
but as applied by whalemen  it becomes so 
a whaleman snipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the taperingpart of leviathan s tail  it averages an inch in thickness  and for therest  is about the size of the iron part of a hoe 
edgewise moved alongthe oily deck  it operates like a leathern squilgee  and by namelessblandishments  as of magic  allures along with it all impurities but to learn all about these recondite matters  your best way is atonce to descend into the blubber room  and have a long talk with itsinmates 
this place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle forthe blanket pieces  when stript and hoisted from the whale 
when theproper time arrives for cutting up its contents  this apartment is ascene of terror to all tyros  especially by night 
on one side  lit bya dull lantern  a space has been left clear for the workmen 
theygenerally go in pairs  a pike and gaffman and a spade man 
thewhaling pike is similar to a frigate s boarding weapon of the samename 
the gaff is something like a boat hook 
with his gaff  thegaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber  and strives to hold it fromslipping  as the ship pitches and lurches about 
meanwhile  thespade man stands on the sheet itself  perpendicularly chopping it intothe portable horse pieces 
this spade is sharp as hone can make it  thespademan s feet are shoeless  the thing he stands on will sometimesirresistibly slide away from him  like a sledge 
if he cuts off one ofhis own toes  or one of his assistants   would you be very muchastonished 
toes are scarce among veteran blubber room men chapter 95 
the cassock had you stepped on board the pequod at a certain juncture of thispost mortemizing of the whale  and had you strolled forward nigh thewindlass  pretty sure am i that you would have scanned with no smallcuriosity a very strange  enigmatical object  which you would have seenthere  lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers 
not the wondrouscistern in the whale s huge head  not the prodigy of his unhinged lowerjaw  not the miracle of his symmetrical tail  none of these would sosurprise you  as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone  longer thana kentuckian is tall  nigh a foot in diameter at the base  andjet black as yojo  the ebony idol of queequeg 
and an idol  indeed  itis  or  rather  in old times  its likeness was 
such an idol as thatfound in the secret groves of queen maachah in judea  and forworshipping which  king asa  her son  did depose her  and destroyed theidol  and burnt it for an abomination at the brook kedron  as darklyset forth in the 15th chapter of the first book of kings look at the sailor  called the mincer  who now comes along  andassisted by two allies  heavily backs the grandissimus  as the marinerscall it  and with bowed shoulders  staggers off with it as if he were agrenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field 
extending it upon theforecastle deck  he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt as an african hunter the pelt of a boa 
this done he turns the peltinside out  like a pantaloon leg  gives it a good stretching  so asalmost to double its diameter  and at last hangs it  well spread  inthe rigging  to dry 
ere long  it is taken down  when removing somethree feet of it  towards the pointed extremity  and then cutting twoslits for arm holes at the other end  he lengthwise slips himselfbodily into it 
the mincer now stands before you invested in the fullcanonicals of his calling 
immemorial to all his order  thisinvestiture alone will adequately protect him  while employed in thepeculiar functions of his office that office consists in mincing the horse pieces of blubber for thepots  an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse planted endwise against the bulwarks  and with a capacious tub beneathit  into which the minced pieces drop  fast as the sheets from a raptorator s desk 
arrayed in decent black  occupying a conspicuous pulpit intent on bible leaves  what a candidate for an archbishopric  what alad for a pope were this mincer 
  bible leaves 
bible leaves 
this is the invariable cry from the matesto the mincer 
it enjoins him to be careful  and cut his work into asthin slices as possible  inasmuch as by so doing the business ofboiling out the oil is much accelerated  and its quantity considerablyincreased  besides perhaps improving it in quality chapter 96 
the try works besides her hoisted boats  an american whaler is outwardlydistinguished by her try works 
she presents the curious anomaly of themost solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting thecompleted ship 
it is as if from the open field a brick kiln weretransported to her planks the try works are planted between the foremast and mainmast  the mostroomy part of the deck 
the timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick andmortar  some ten feet by eight square  and five in height 
thefoundation does not penetrate the deck  but the masonry is firmlysecured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on allsides  and screwing it down to the timbers 
on the flanks it is casedwith wood  and at top completely covered by a large  sloping  battenedhatchway 
removing this hatch we expose the great try pots  two innumber  and each of several barrels  capacity 
when not in use  theyare kept remarkably clean 
sometimes they are polished with soapstoneand sand  till they shine within like silver punch bowls 
during thenight watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coilthemselves away there for a nap 
while employed in polishing them oneman in each pot  side by side many confidential communications arecarried on  over the iron lips 
it is a place also for profoundmathematical meditation 
it was in the left hand try pot of the pequod with the soapstone diligently circling round me  that i was firstindirectly struck by the remarkable fact  that in geometry all bodiesgliding along the cycloid  my soapstone for example  will descend fromany point in precisely the same time removing the fire board from the front of the try works  the baremasonry of that side is exposed  penetrated by the two iron mouths ofthe furnaces  directly underneath the pots 
these mouths are fittedwith heavy doors of iron 
the intense heat of the fire is preventedfrom communicating itself to the deck  by means of a shallow reservoirextending under the entire inclosed surface of the works 
by a tunnelinserted at the rear  this reservoir is kept replenished with water asfast as it evaporates 
there are no external chimneys  they open directfrom the rear wall 
and here let us go back for a moment it was about nine o clock at night that the pequod s try works werefirst started on this present voyage 
it belonged to stubb to overseethe business  all ready there 
off hatch  then  and start her 
you cook  fire theworks   this was an easy thing  for the carpenter had been thrustinghis shavings into the furnace throughout the passage 
here be it saidthat in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try works has to be fedfor a time with wood 
after that no wood is used  except as a means ofquick ignition to the staple fuel 
in a word  after being tried out the crisp  shrivelled blubber  now called scraps or fritters  stillcontains considerable of its unctuous properties 
these fritters feedthe flames 
like a plethoric burning martyr  or a self consumingmisanthrope  once ignited  the whale supplies his own fuel and burns byhis own body 
would that he consumed his own smoke 
for his smoke ishorrible to inhale  and inhale it you must  and not only that  but youmust live in it for the time 
it has an unspeakable  wild  hindoo odorabout it  such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres 
it smellslike the left wing of the day of judgment  it is an argument for thepit by midnight the works were in full operation 
we were clear from thecarcase  sail had been made  the wind was freshening  the wild oceandarkness was intense 
but that darkness was licked up by the fierceflames  which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues  andilluminated every lofty rope in the rigging  as with the famed greekfire 
the burning ship drove on  as if remorselessly commissioned tosome vengeful deed 
so the pitch and sulphur freighted brigs of thebold hydriote  canaris  issuing from their midnight harbors  with broadsheets of flame for sails  bore down upon the turkish frigates  andfolded them in conflagrations the hatch  removed from the top of the works  now afforded a widehearth in front of them 
standing on this were the tartarean shapes ofthe pagan harpooneers  always the whale ship s stokers 
with hugepronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scaldingpots  or stirred up the fires beneath  till the snaky flames darted curling  out of the doors to catch them by the feet 
the smoke rolledaway in sullen heaps 
to every pitch of the ship there was a pitch ofthe boiling oil  which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces opposite the mouth of the works  on the further side of the wide woodenhearth  was the windlass 
this served for a sea sofa 
here lounged thewatch  when not otherwise employed  looking into the red heat of thefire  till their eyes felt scorched in their heads 
their tawnyfeatures  now all begrimed with smoke and sweat  their matted beards and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth  all these werestrangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works 
as theynarrated to each other their unholy adventures  their tales of terrortold in words of mirth  as their uncivilized laughter forked upwardsout of them  like the flames from the furnace  as to and fro  in theirfront  the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge prongedforks and dippers  as the wind howled on  and the sea leaped  and theship groaned and dived  and yet steadfastly shot her red hell furtherand further into the blackness of the sea and the night  and scornfullychamped the white bone in her mouth  and viciously spat round her onall sides  then the rushing pequod  freighted with savages  and ladenwith fire  and burning a corpse  and plunging into that blackness ofdarkness  seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander ssoul so seemed it to me  as i stood at her helm  and for long hours silentlyguided the way of this fire ship on the sea 
wrapped  for thatinterval  in darkness myself  i but the better saw the redness  themadness  the ghastliness of others 
the continual sight of the fiendshapes before me  capering half in smoke and half in fire  these atlast begat kindred visions in my soul  so soon as i began to yield tothat unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at amidnight helm but that night  in particular  a strange  and ever since inexplicable thing occurred to me 
starting from a brief standing sleep  i washorribly conscious of something fatally wrong 
the jaw bone tillersmote my side  which leaned against it  in my ears was the low hum ofsails  just beginning to shake in the wind  i thought my eyes wereopen  i was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids andmechanically stretching them still further apart 
but  spite of allthis  i could see no compass before me to steer by  though it seemedbut a minute since i had been watching the card  by the steady binnaclelamp illuminating it 
nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom  now andthen made ghastly by flashes of redness 
uppermost was the impression that whatever swift  rushing thing i stood on was not so much bound toany haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern 
a stark  bewilderedfeeling  as of death  came over me 
convulsively my hands grasped thetiller  but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was  somehow  insome enchanted way  inverted 
my god 
what is the matter with me thought i 
in my brief sleep i had turned myself about  and wasfronting the ship s stern  with my back to her prow and the compass 
inan instant i faced back  just in time to prevent the vessel from flyingup into the wind  and very probably capsizing her 
how glad and howgrateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night  andthe fatal contingency of being brought by the lee look not too long in the face of the fire  o man 
never dream with thyhand on the helm 
turn not thy back to the compass  accept the firsthint of the hitching tiller  believe not the artificial fire  when itsredness makes all things look ghastly 
to morrow  in the natural sun the skies will be bright  those who glared like devils in the forkingflames  the morn will show in far other  at least gentler  relief  theglorious  golden  glad sun  the only true lamp all others but liars nevertheless the sun hides not virginia s dismal swamp  nor rome saccursed campagna  nor wide sahara  nor all the millions of miles ofdeserts and of griefs beneath the moon 
the sun hides not the ocean which is the dark side of this earth  and which is two thirds of thisearth 
so  therefore  that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrowin him  that mortal man cannot be true not true  or undeveloped 
withbooks the same 
the truest of all men was the man of sorrows  and thetruest of all books is solomon s  and ecclesiastes is the fine hammeredsteel of woe 
 all is vanity   all 
this wilful world hath not got holdof unchristian solomon s wisdom yet 
but he who dodges hospitals andjails  and walks fast crossing graveyards  and would rather talk ofoperas than hell  calls cowper  young  pascal  rousseau  poor devilsall of sick men  and throughout a care free lifetime swears by rabelaisas passing wise  and therefore jolly  not that man is fitted to sitdown on tomb stones  and break the green damp mould with unfathomablywondrous solomon but even solomon  he says   the man that wandereth out of the way ofunderstanding shall remain   i e   even while living   in thecongregation of the dead   give not thyself up  then  to fire  lest itinvert thee  deaden thee  as for the time it did me 
there is a wisdomthat is woe  but there is a woe that is madness 
and there is acatskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackestgorges  and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunnyspaces 
and even if he for ever flies within the gorge  that gorge isin the mountains  so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagleis still higher than other birds upon the plain  even though they soar chapter 97 
the lamp had you descended from the pequod s try works to the pequod sforecastle  where the off duty watch were sleeping  for one singlemoment you would have almost thought you were standing in someilluminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors 
there they layin their triangular oaken vaults  each mariner a chiselled muteness  ascore of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes in merchantmen  oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk ofqueens 
to dress in the dark  and eat in the dark  and stumble indarkness to his pallet  this is his usual lot 
but the whaleman  as heseeks the food of light  so he lives in light 
he makes his berth analaddin s lamp  and lays him down in it  so that in the pitchiest nightthe ship s black hull still houses an illumination see with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful oflamps often but old bottles and vials  though to the copper cooler atthe try works  and replenishes them there  as mugs of ale at a vat 
heburns  too  the purest of oil  in its unmanufactured  and  therefore unvitiated state  a fluid unknown to solar  lunar  or astralcontrivances ashore 
it is sweet as early grass butter in april

stowing down and clearing up already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar offdescried from the mast head  how he is chased over the watery moors and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep  how he is then towedalongside and beheaded  and how  on the principle which entitled theheadsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed  hisgreat padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner  how  indue time  he is condemned to the pots  and  like shadrach  meshach  andabednego  his spermaceti  oil  and bone pass unscathed through thefire  but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part ofthe description by rehearsing singing  if i may the romantic proceedingof decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into thehold  where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities sliding along beneath the surface as before  but  alas 
never more torise and blow while still warm  the oil  like hot punch  is received into thesix barrel casks  and while  perhaps  the ship is pitching and rollingthis way and that in the midnight sea  the enormous casks are slewedround and headed over  end for end  and sometimes perilously scootacross the slippery deck  like so many land slides  till at lastman handled and stayed in their course  and all round the hoops  rap rap  go as many hammers as can play upon them  for now  ex officio every sailor is a cooper at length  when the last pint is casked  and all is cool  then thegreat hatchways are unsealed  the bowels of the ship are thrown open and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea 
this done  thehatches are replaced  and hermetically closed  like a closet walled up in the sperm fishery  this is perhaps one of the most remarkableincidents in all the business of whaling 
one day the planks streamwith freshets of blood and oil  on the sacred quarter deck enormousmasses of the whale s head are profanely piled  great rusty casks lieabout  as in a brewery yard  the smoke from the try works has besootedall the bulwarks  the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness  theentire ship seems great leviathan himself  while on all hands the dinis deafening but a day or two after  you look about you  and prick your ears in thisself same ship  and were it not for the tell tale boats and try works you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel  with amost scrupulously neat commander 
the unmanufactured sperm oilpossesses a singularly cleansing virtue 
this is the reason why thedecks never look so white as just after what they call an affair ofoil 
besides  from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale  apotent lye is readily made  and whenever any adhesiveness from the backof the whale remains clinging to the side  that lye quicklyexterminates it 
hands go diligently along the bulwarks  and withbuckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness 
the sootis brushed from the lower rigging 
all the numerous implements whichhave been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away 
thegreat hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try works  completelyhiding the pots  every cask is out of sight  all tackles are coiled inunseen nooks  and when by the combined and simultaneous industry ofalmost the entire ship s company  the whole of this conscientious dutyis at last concluded  then the crew themselves proceed to their ownablutions  shift themselves from top to toe  and finally issue to theimmaculate deck  fresh and all aglow  as bridegrooms new leaped fromout the daintiest holland now  with elated step  they pace the planks in twos and threes  andhumorously discourse of parlors  sofas  carpets  and fine cambrics propose to mat the deck  think of having hanging to the top  object notto taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle 
to hint tosuch musked mariners of oil  and bone  and blubber  were little shortof audacity 
they know not the thing you distantly allude to 
away  andbring us napkins but mark  aloft there  at the three mast heads  stand three men intenton spying out more whales  which  if caught  infallibly will again soilthe old oaken furniture  and drop at least one small grease spotsomewhere 
yes  and many is the time  when  after the severestuninterrupted labors  which know no night  continuing straight throughfor ninety six hours  when from the boat  where they have swelled theirwrists with all day rowing on the line  they only step to the deck tocarry vast chains  and heave the heavy windlass  and cut and slash yea  and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by thecombined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try works when  on the heel of all this  they have finally bestirred themselvesto cleanse the ship  and make a spotless dairy room of it  many is thetime the poor fellows  just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks are startled by the cry of  there she blows   and away they fly tofight another whale  and go through the whole weary thing again 
myfriends  but this is man killing

when he halted before thebinnacle  with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in thecompass  that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity ofhis purpose  and when resuming his walk he again paused before themainmast  then  as the same riveted glance fastened upon the rivetedgold coin there  he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness  onlydashed with a certain wild longing  if not hopefulness but one morning  turning to pass the doubloon  he seemed to be newlyattracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it  asthough now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself insome monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them 
and somecertain significance lurks in all things  else all things are littleworth  and the round world itself but an empty cipher  except to sellby the cartload  as they do hills about boston  to fill up some morassin the milky way now this doubloon was of purest  virgin gold  raked somewhere out ofthe heart of gorgeous hills  whence  east and west  over golden sands the head waters of many a pactolus flows 
and though now nailed amidstall the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes yet  untouchable and immaculate to any foulness  it still preserved itsquito glow 
nor  though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hourpassed by ruthless hands  and through the livelong nights shrouded withthick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach  neverthelessevery sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last 
for itwas set apart and sanctified to one awe striking end  and howeverwanton in their sailor ways  one and all  the mariners revered it asthe white whale s talisman 
sometimes they talked it over in the wearywatch by night  wondering whose it was to be at last  and whether hewould ever live to spend it now those noble golden coins of south america are as medals of the sunand tropic token pieces 
here palms  alpacas  and volcanoes  sun sdisks and stars  ecliptics  horns of plenty  and rich banners waving are in luxuriant profusion stamped  so that the precious gold seemsalmost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories  bypassing through those fancy mints  so spanishly poetic it so chanced that the doubloon of the pequod was a most wealthyexample of these things 
on its round border it bore the letters republica del ecuador  quito 
so this bright coin came from a countryplanted in the middle of the world  and beneath the great equator  andnamed after it  and it had been cast midway up the andes  in theunwaning clime that knows no autumn 
zoned by those letters you saw thelikeness of three andes  summits  from one a flame  a tower on another on the third a crowing cock  while arching over all was a segment ofthe partitioned zodiac  the signs all marked with their usualcabalistics  and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point atlibra before this equatorial coin  ahab  not unobserved by others  was nowpausing  there s something ever egotistical in mountain tops and towers  andall other grand and lofty things  look here  three peaks as proud aslucifer 
the firm tower  that is ahab  the volcano  that is ahab  thecourageous  the undaunted  and victorious fowl  that  too  is ahab  allare ahab  and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe which  like a magician s glass  to each and every man in turn butmirrors back his own mysterious self 
great pains  small gains forthose who ask the world to solve them  it cannot solve itself 
methinksnow this coined sun wears a ruddy face  but see 
aye  he enters thesign of storms  the equinox 
and but six months before he wheeled outof a former equinox at aries 
from storm to storm 
so be it  then 
bornin throes   tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs 
sobe it  then 
here s stout stuff for woe to work on 
so be it  then   no fairy fingers can have pressed the gold  but devil s claws musthave left their mouldings there since yesterday   murmured starbuck tohimself  leaning against the bulwarks 
 the old man seems to readbelshazzar s awful writing 
i have never marked the coin inspectingly he goes below  let me read 
a dark valley between three mighty heaven abiding peaks  that almost seem the trinity  in some faintearthly symbol 
so in this vale of death  god girds us round  and overall our gloom  the sun of righteousness still shines a beacon and ahope 
if we bend down our eyes  the dark vale shows her mouldy soil but if we lift them  the bright sun meets our glance half way  tocheer 
yet  oh  the great sun is no fixture  and if  at midnight  wewould fain snatch some sweet solace from him  we gaze for him in vain this coin speaks wisely  mildly  truly  but still sadly to me 
i willquit it  lest truth shake me falsely   there now s the old mogul   soliloquized stubb by the try works   he sbeen twigging it  and there goes starbuck from the same  and both withfaces which i should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long and all from looking at a piece of gold  which did i have it now onnegro hill or in corlaer s hook  i d not look at it very long erespending it 
in my poor  insignificant opinion  i regard this asqueer 
i have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings  your doubloonsof old spain  your doubloons of peru  your doubloons of chili  yourdoubloons of bolivia  your doubloons of popayan  with plenty of goldmoidores and pistoles  and joes  and half joes  and quarter joes 
whatthen should there be in this doubloon of the equator that is so killingwonderful 
by golconda 
let me read it once 
here s signs andwonders truly 
that  now  is what old bowditch in his epitome calls thezodiac  and what my almanac below calls ditto 
i ll get the almanac andas i have heard devils can be raised with daboll s arithmetic  i ll trymy hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with themassachusetts calendar 
here s the book 
let s see now 
signs andwonders  and the sun  he s always among  em 
hem  hem  hem  here theyare here they go all alive  aries  or the ram  taurus  or the bull andjimimi 
here s gemini himself  or the twins 
well  the sun he wheelsamong  em 
aye  here on the coin he s just crossing the thresholdbetween two of twelve sitting rooms all in a ring 
you lie there the fact is  you books must know your places 
you ll do to give us thebare words and facts  but we come in to supply the thoughts 
that s mysmall experience  so far as the massachusetts calendar  and bowditch snavigator  and daboll s arithmetic go 
signs and wonders  eh 
pity ifthere is nothing wonderful in signs  and significant in wonders there s a clue somewhere  wait a bit  hist hark 
by jove  i have it look you  doubloon  your zodiac here is the life of man in one roundchapter  and now i ll read it off  straight out of the book 
to begin  there s aries  or the ram lecherous dog  he begetsus  then  taurus  or the bull he bumps us the first thing  then gemini or the twins that is  virtue and vice  we try to reach virtue  when lo comes cancer the crab  and drags us back  and here  going from virtue leo  a roaring lion  lies in the path he gives a few fierce bites andsurly dabs with his paw  we escape  and hail virgo  the virgin 
that sour first love  we marry and think to be happy for aye  when pop comeslibra  or the scales happiness weighed and found wanting  and while weare very sad about that  lord 
how we suddenly jump  as scorpio  or thescorpion  stings us in the rear  we are curing the wound  when whangcome the arrows all round  sagittarius  or the archer  is amusinghimself 
as we pluck out the shafts  stand aside 
here s thebattering ram  capricornus  or the goat  full tilt  he comes rushing and headlong we are tossed  when aquarius  or the water bearer  poursout his whole deluge and drowns us  and to wind up with pisces  or thefishes  we sleep 
there s a sermon now  writ in high heaven  and thesun goes through it every year  and yet comes out of it all alive andhearty 
jollily he  aloft there  wheels through toil and trouble  andso  alow here  does jolly stubb 
oh  jolly s the word for aye 
but stop  here comes little king post  dodge round thetry works  now  and let s hear what he ll have to say 
there  he sbefore it  he ll out with something presently 
so  so  he s beginning   i see nothing here  but a round thing made of gold  and whoever raisesa certain whale  this round thing belongs to him 
so  what s all thisstaring been about 
it is worth sixteen dollars  that s true  and attwo cents the cigar  that s nine hundred and sixty cigars 
i won tsmoke dirty pipes like stubb  but i like cigars  and here s ninehundred and sixty of them  so here goes flask aloft to spy  em out   shall i call that wise or foolish  now  if it be really wise it has afoolish look to it  yet  if it be really foolish  then has it a sort ofwiseish look to it 
but  avast  here comes our old manxman the oldhearse driver  he must have been  that is  before he took to the sea he luffs up before the doubloon  halloa  and goes round on the otherside of the mast  why  there s a horse shoe nailed on that side  andnow he s back again  what does that mean 
he s muttering voicelike an old worn out coffee mill 
prick ears  and listen   if the white whale be raised  it must be in a month and a day  whenthe sun stands in some one of these signs 
i ve studied signs  and knowtheir marks  they were taught me two score years ago  by the old witchin copenhagen 
now  in what sign will the sun then be 
the horse shoesign  for there it is  right opposite the gold 
and what s thehorse shoe sign 
the lion is the horse shoe sign the roaring anddevouring lion 
ship  old ship 
my old head shakes to think of thee   there s another rendering now  but still one text 
all sorts of men inone kind of world  you see 
dodge again 
here comes queequeg alltattooing looks like the signs of the zodiac himself 
what says thecannibal 
as i live he s comparing notes  looking at his thigh bone thinks the sun is in the thigh  or in the calf  or in the bowels  isuppose  as the old women talk surgeon s astronomy in the back country and by jove  he s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh iguess it s sagittarius  or the archer 
no  he don t know what to makeof the doubloon  he takes it for an old button off some king strowsers 
but  aside again 
here comes that ghost devil  fedallah  tailcoiled out of sight as usual  oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual what does he say  with that look of his 
ah  only makes a sign to thesign and bows himself  there is a sun on the coin fire worshipper depend upon it 
more and more 
this way comes pip poor boy 
wouldhe had died  or i  he s half horrible to me 
he too has been watchingall of these interpreters myself included and look now  he comes toread  with that unearthly idiot face

leg and arm the pequod  of nantucket  meets the samuel enderby  of london  ship  ahoy 
hast seen the white whale  so cried ahab  once more hailing a ship showing english colours bearing down under the stern 
trumpet to mouth  the old man wasstanding in his hoisted quarter boat  his ivory leg plainly revealed tothe stranger captain  who was carelessly reclining in his own boat sbow 
he was a darkly tanned  burly  good natured  fine looking man  ofsixty or thereabouts  dressed in a spacious roundabout  that hung roundhim in festoons of blue pilot cloth  and one empty arm of this jacketstreamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar s surcoat  hast seen the white whale   see you this   and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone  terminating in a woodenhead like a mallet  man my boat   cried ahab  impetuously  and tossing about the oars nearhim  stand by to lower  in less than a minute  without quitting his little craft  he and hiscrew were dropped to the water  and were soon alongside of thestranger 
but here a curious difficulty presented itself 
in theexcitement of the moment  ahab had forgotten that since the loss of hisleg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but hisown  and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanicalcontrivance peculiar to the pequod  and a thing not to be rigged andshipped in any other vessel at a moment s warning 
now  it is no veryeasy matter for anybody except those who are almost hourly used to it like whalemen to clamber up a ship s side from a boat on the open sea for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson 
so deprived of one leg  and the strange ship of course being altogetherunsupplied with the kindly invention  ahab now found himself abjectlyreduced to a clumsy landsman again  hopelessly eyeing the uncertainchangeful height he could hardly hope to attain it has before been hinted  perhaps  that every little untowardcircumstance that befell him  and which indirectly sprang from hisluckless mishap  almost invariably irritated or exasperated ahab 
andin the present instance  all this was heightened by the sight of thetwo officers of the strange ship  leaning over the side  by theperpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there  and swinging towards him apair of tastefully ornamented man ropes  for at first they did not seemto bethink them that a one legged man must be too much of a cripple touse their sea bannisters 
but this awkwardness only lasted a minute because the strange captain  observing at a glance how affairs stood cried out   i see  i see  avast heaving there 
jump  boys  and swingover the cutting tackle  as good luck would have it  they had had a whale alongside a day or twoprevious  and the great tackles were still aloft  and the massivecurved blubber hook  now clean and dry  was still attached to the end this was quickly lowered to ahab  who at once comprehending it all slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook  it was like sittingin the fluke of an anchor  or the crotch of an apple tree   and thengiving the word  held himself fast  and at the same time also helped tohoist his own weight  by pulling hand over hand upon one of the runningparts of the tackle 
soon he was carefully swung inside the highbulwarks  and gently landed upon the capstan head 
with his ivory armfrankly thrust forth in welcome  the other captain advanced  and ahab putting out his ivory leg  and crossing the ivory arm  like twosword fish blades  cried out in his walrus way   aye  aye  hearty 
letus shake bones together  an arm and a leg  an arm that never canshrink  d ye see  and a leg that never can run 
where did st thou seethe white whale  how long ago   the white whale   said the englishman  pointing his ivory arm towardsthe east  and taking a rueful sight along it  as if it had been atelescope   there i saw him  on the line  last season   and he took that arm off  did he   asked ahab  now sliding down fromthe capstan  and resting on the englishman s shoulder  as he did so  aye  he was the cause of it  at least  and that leg  too   spin me the yarn   said ahab   how was it   it was the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the line  began the englishman 
 i was ignorant of the white whale at that time well  one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales  and my boatfastened to one of them  a regular circus horse he was  too  that wentmilling and milling round so  that my boat s crew could only trim dish by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale 
presently up breachesfrom the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale  with a milky whitehead and hump  all crows  feet and wrinkles   it was he  it was he   cried ahab  suddenly letting out his suspendedbreath  and harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin   aye  aye they were mine my irons   cried ahab  exultingly  but on   give me a chance  then   said the englishman  good humoredly 
 well this old great grandfather  with the white head and hump  runs allafoam into the pod  and goes to snapping furiously at my fast line  aye  i see  wanted to part it  free the fast fish an old trick i knowhim   how it was exactly   continued the one armed commander   i do notknow  but in biting the line  it got foul of his teeth  caught theresomehow  but we didn t know it then  so that when we afterwards pulledon the line  bounce we came plump on to his hump 
instead of the otherwhale s  that went off to windward  all fluking 
seeing how mattersstood  and what a noble great whale it was the noblest and biggest iever saw  sir  in my life i resolved to capture him  spite of theboiling rage he seemed to be in 
and thinking the hap hazard line wouldget loose  or the tooth it was tangled to might draw  for i have adevil of a boat s crew for a pull on a whale line   seeing all this  isay  i jumped into my first mate s boat mr 
mounttop s here  by theway  captain mounttop  mounttop the captain   as i was saying  i jumpedinto mounttop s boat  which  d ye see  was gunwale and gunwale withmine  then  and snatching the first harpoon  let this oldgreat grandfather have it 
but  lord  look you  sir hearts and soulsalive  man the next instant  in a jiff  i was blind as a bat both eyesout all befogged and bedeadened with black foam the whale s taillooming straight up out of it  perpendicular in the air  like a marblesteeple 
no use sterning all  then  but as i was groping at midday with a blinding sun  all crown jewels  as i was groping  i say  afterthe second iron  to toss it overboard down comes the tail like a limatower  cutting my boat in two  leaving each half in splinters  and flukes first  the white hump backed through the wreck  as though it wasall chips 
we all struck out 
to escape his terrible flailings  iseized hold of my harpoon pole sticking in him  and for a moment clungto that like a sucking fish 
but a combing sea dashed me off  and atthe same instant  the fish  taking one good dart forwards  went downlike a flash  and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along nearme caught me here   clapping his hand just below his shoulder    yes caught me just here  i say  and bore me down to hell s flames  i wasthinking  when  when  all of a sudden  thank the good god  the barbript its way along the flesh clear along the whole length of myarm came out nigh my wrist  and up i floated  and that gentleman therewill tell you the rest  by the way  captain dr 
bunger  ship s surgeon bunger  my lad  the captain  
now  bunger boy  spin your part of theyarn  the professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out  had been allthe time standing near them  with nothing specific visible  to denotehis gentlemanly rank on board 
his face was an exceedingly round butsober one  he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt  andpatched trowsers  and had thus far been dividing his attention betweena marlingspike he held in one hand  and a pill box held in the other occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the twocrippled captains 
but  at his superior s introduction of him to ahab he politely bowed  and straightway went on to do his captain s bidding  it was a shocking bad wound   began the whale surgeon   and  taking myadvice  captain boomer here  stood our old sammy   samuel enderby is the name of my ship   interrupted the one armedcaptain  addressing ahab   go on  boy   stood our old sammy off to the northward  to get out of the blazinghot weather there on the line 
but it was no use i did all i could  satup with him nights  was very severe with him in the matter of diet   oh  very severe   chimed in the patient himself  then suddenlyaltering his voice   drinking hot rum toddies with me every night  tillhe couldn t see to put on the bandages  and sending me to bed  halfseas over  about three o clock in the morning 
oh  ye stars 
he sat upwith me indeed  and was very severe in my diet 
a great watcher and very dietetically severe  is dr  bunger 
 bunger  you dog  laughout 
why don t ye 
you know you re a precious jolly rascal  
but  heaveahead  boy  i d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any otherman   my captain  you must have ere this perceived  respected sir  said theimperturbable godly looking bunger  slightly bowing to ahab  is apt tobe facetious at times  he spins us many clever things of that sort 
buti may as well say en passant  as the french remark that i myself thatis to say  jack bunger  late of the reverend clergy am a strict totalabstinence man  i never drink   water   cried the captain   he never drinks it  it s a sort of fits tohim  fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia  but go on go on withthe arm story   yes  i may as well   said the surgeon  coolly 
 i was about observing sir  before captain boomer s facetious interruption  that spite of mybest and severest endeavors  the wound kept getting worse and worse the truth was  sir  it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw more than two feet and several inches long 
i measured it with the leadline 
in short  it grew black  i knew what was threatened  and off itcame 
but i had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there  that thing isagainst all rule  pointing at it with the marlingspike  that is thecaptain s work  not mine  he ordered the carpenter to make it  he hadthat club hammer there put to the end  to knock some one s brains outwith  i suppose  as he tried mine once 
he flies into diabolicalpassions sometimes 
do ye see this dent  sir  removing his hat  andbrushing aside his hair  and exposing a bowl like cavity in his skull but which bore not the slightest scarry trace  or any token of everhaving been a wound  well  the captain there will tell you how thatcame here  he knows   no  i don t   said the captain   but his mother did  he was born withit 
oh  you solemn rogue  you you bunger 
was there ever such anotherbunger in the watery world 
bunger  when you die  you ought to die inpickle  you dog  you should be preserved to future ages  you rascal   what became of the white whale   now cried ahab  who thus far had beenimpatiently listening to this by play between the two englishmen  oh   cried the one armed captain   oh  yes 
well  after he sounded  wedidn t see him again for some time  in fact  as i before hinted  ididn t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick till some time afterwards  when coming back to the line  we heard aboutmoby dick as some call him and then i knew it was he   did st thou cross his wake again   twice   but could not fasten   didn t want to try to  ain t one limb enough 
what should i do withoutthis other arm 
and i m thinking moby dick doesn t bite so much as heswallows   well  then   interrupted bunger   give him your left arm for bait toget the right 
do you know  gentlemen  very gravely and mathematicallybowing to each captain in succession  do you know  gentlemen  that thedigestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divineprovidence  that it is quite impossible for him to completely digesteven a man s arm 
and he knows it too 
so that what you take for thewhite whale s malice is only his awkwardness 
for he never means toswallow a single limb  he only thinks to terrify by feints 
butsometimes he is like the old juggling fellow  formerly a patient ofmine in ceylon  that making believe swallow jack knives  once upon atime let one drop into him in good earnest  and there it stayed for atwelvemonth or more  when i gave him an emetic  and he heaved it up insmall tacks  d ye see 
no possible way for him to digest thatjack knife  and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system yes  captain boomer  if you are quick enough about it  and have a mindto pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burialto the other  why in that case the arm is yours  only let the whalehave another chance at you shortly  that s all   no  thank ye  bunger   said the english captain   he s welcome to thearm he has  since i can t help it  and didn t know him then  but not toanother one 
no more white whales for me  i ve lowered for him once and that has satisfied me 
there would be great glory in killing him  iknow that  and there is a ship load of precious sperm in him  but  harkye  he s best let alone  don t you think so  captain   glancing at theivory leg  he is 
but he will still be hunted  for all that 
what is best letalone  that accursed thing is not always what least allures 
he s all amagnet 
how long since thou saw st him last 
which way heading   bless my soul  and curse the foul fiend s   cried bunger  stoopinglywalking round ahab  and like a dog  strangely snuffing   this man sblood bring the thermometer  it s at the boiling point  his pulse makesthese planks beat  sir   taking a lancet from his pocket  and drawingnear to ahab s arm  avast   roared ahab  dashing him against the bulwarks  man the boat which way heading   good god   cried the english captain  to whom the question was put  what s the matter 
he was heading east  i think  is your captaincrazy   whispering fedallah but fedallah  putting a finger on his lip  slid over the bulwarks totake the boat s steering oar  and ahab  swinging the cutting tackletowards him  commanded the ship s sailors to stand by to lower in a moment he was standing in the boat s stern  and the manilla menwere springing to their oars 
in vain the english captain hailed him with back to the stranger ship  and face set like a flint to his own ahab stood upright till alongside of the pequod chapter 101 
the decanter ere the english ship fades from sight  be it set down here  that shehailed from london  and was named after the late samuel enderby merchant of that city  the original of the famous whaling house ofenderby   sons  a house which in my poor whaleman s opinion  comes notfar behind the united royal houses of the tudors and bourbons  in pointof real historical interest 
how long  prior to the year of our lord1775  this great whaling house was in existence  my numerousfish documents do not make plain  but in that year  1775  it fitted outthe first english ships that ever regularly hunted the sperm whale though for some score of years previous  ever since 1726  our valiantcoffins and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had in large fleetspursued that leviathan  but only in the north and south atlantic  notelsewhere 
be it distinctly recorded here  that the nantucketers werethe first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great spermwhale  and that for half a century they were the only people of thewhole globe who so harpooned him in 1778  a fine ship  the amelia  fitted out for the express purpose and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys  boldly rounded capehorn  and was the first among the nations to lower a whale boat of anysort in the great south sea 
the voyage was a skilful and lucky one and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm the amelia s example was soon followed by other ships  english andamerican  and thus the vast sperm whale grounds of the pacific werethrown open 
but not content with this good deed  the indefatigablehouse again bestirred itself  samuel and all his sons how many  theirmother only knows and under their immediate auspices  and partly  ithink  at their expense  the british government was induced to send thesloop of war rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the southsea 
commanded by a naval post captain  the rattler made a rattlingvoyage of it  and did some service  how much does not appear 
but thisis not all 
in 1819  the same house fitted out a discovery whale shipof their own  to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of japan that ship well called the  syren  made a noble experimental cruise  andit was thus that the great japanese whaling ground first becamegenerally known 
the syren in this famous voyage was commanded by acaptain coffin  a nantucketer all honor to the enderbies  therefore  whose house  i think  exists tothe present day  though doubtless the original samuel must long agohave slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other world the ship named after him was worthy of the honor  being a very fastsailer and a noble craft every way 
i boarded her once at midnightsomewhere off the patagonian coast  and drank good flip down in theforecastle 
it was a fine gam we had  and they were all trumps everysoul on board 
a short life to them  and a jolly death 
and that finegam i had long  very long after old ahab touched her planks with hisivory heel it minds me of the noble  solid  saxon hospitality of thatship  and may my parson forget me  and the devil remember me  if i everlose sight of it 
did i say we had flip 
yes  and we flipped itat the rate of ten gallons the hour  and when the squall came  for it ssqually off there by patagonia   and all hands visitors and all werecalled to reef topsails  we were so top heavy that we had to swing eachother aloft in bowlines  and we ignorantly furled the skirts of ourjackets into the sails  so that we hung there  reefed fast in thehowling gale  a warning example to all drunken tars 
however  the mastsdid not go overboard  and by and by we scrambled down  so sober  thatwe had to pass the flip again  though the savage salt spray burstingdown the forecastle scuttle  rather too much diluted and pickled it tomy taste the beef was fine tough  but with body in it 
they said it wasbull beef  others  that it was dromedary beef  but i do not know  forcertain  how that was 
they had dumplings too  small  but substantial symmetrically globular  and indestructible dumplings 
i fancied thatyou could feel them  and roll them about in you after they wereswallowed 
if you stooped over too far forward  you risked theirpitching out of you like billiard balls 
the bread but that couldn t behelped  besides  it was an anti scorbutic  in short  the breadcontained the only fresh fare they had 
but the forecastle was not verylight  and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when youate it 
but all in all  taking her from truck to helm  considering thedimensions of the cook s boilers  including his own live parchmentboilers  fore and aft  i say  the samuel enderby was a jolly ship  ofgood fare and plenty  fine flip and strong  crack fellows all  andcapital from boot heels to hat band but why was it  think ye  that the samuel enderby  and some otherenglish whalers i know of not all though were such famous  hospitableships  that passed round the beef  and the bread  and the can  and thejoke  and were not soon weary of eating  and drinking  and laughing 
iwill tell you 
the abounding good cheer of these english whalers ismatter for historical research 
nor have i been at all sparing ofhistorical whale research  when it has seemed needed the english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollanders zealanders  and danes  from whom they derived many terms still extantin the fishery  and what is yet more  their fat old fashions  touchingplenty to eat and drink 
for  as a general thing  the englishmerchant ship scrimps her crew  but not so the english whaler 
hence in the english  this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal andnatural  but incidental and particular  and  therefore  must have somespecial origin  which is here pointed out  and will be still furtherelucidated during my researches in the leviathanic histories  i stumbled upon anancient dutch volume  which  by the musty whaling smell of it  i knewmust be about whalers 
the title was   dan coopman   wherefore iconcluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdamcooper in the fishery  as every whale ship must carry its cooper 
i wasreinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one fitz swackhammer   but my friend dr  snodhead  a very learned man professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa clausand st  pott s  to whom i handed the work for translation  giving him abox of sperm candles for his trouble this same dr  snodhead  so soon ashe spied the book  assured me that  dan coopman  did not mean  thecooper   but  the merchant   in short  this ancient and learned lowdutch book treated of the commerce of holland  and  among othersubjects  contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery and in this chapter it was  headed   smeer   or  fat   that i found along detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180sail of dutch whalemen  from which list  as translated by dr  snodhead i transcribe the following 400 000 lbs 
of beef 
60 000 lbs 
friesland pork 
150 000 lbs 
of stockfish 
550 000 lbs 
of biscuit 
72 000 lbs 
of soft bread 
2 800 firkinsof butter 
20 000 lbs 
texel   leyden cheese 
144 000 lbs 
cheese probably an inferior article  
550 ankers of geneva 
10 800 barrels ofbeer most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading  not so inthe present case  however  where the reader is flooded with wholepipes  barrels  quarts  and gills of good gin and good cheer at the time  i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all thisbeer  beef  and bread  during which many profound thoughts wereincidentally suggested to me  capable of a transcendental and platonicapplication  and  furthermore  i compiled supplementary tables of myown  touching the probable quantity of stock fish  etc   consumed byevery low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergenwhale fishery 
in the first place  the amount of butter  and texel andleyden cheese consumed  seems amazing 
i impute it  though  to theirnaturally unctuous natures  being rendered still more unctuous by thenature of their vocation  and especially by their pursuing their gamein those frigid polar seas  on the very coasts of that esquimauxcountry where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers oftrain oil the quantity of beer  too  is very large  10 800 barrels 
now  as thosepolar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of thatclimate  so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen including the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea  did notmuch exceed three months  say  and reckoning 30 men to each of theirfleet of 180 sail  we have 5 400 low dutch seamen in all  therefore  isay  we have precisely two barrels of beer per man  for a twelve weeks allowance  exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin now  whether these gin and beer harpooneers  so fuddled as one mightfancy them to have been  were the right sort of men to stand up in aboat s head  and take good aim at flying whales  this would seemsomewhat improbable 
yet they did aim at them  and hit them too 
butthis was very far north  be it remembered  where beer agrees well withthe constitution  upon the equator  in our southern fishery  beer wouldbe apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast head and boozy in hisboat  and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford but no more  enough has been said to show that the old dutch whalers oftwo or three centuries ago were high livers  and that the englishwhalers have not neglected so excellent an example 
for  say they  whencruising in an empty ship  if you can get nothing better out of theworld  get a good dinner out of it  at least 
and this empties thedecanter chapter 102 
a bower in the arsacides hitherto  in descriptively treating of the sperm whale  i have chieflydwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect  or separately and in detailupon some few interior structural features 
but to a large and thoroughsweeping comprehension of him  it behooves me now to unbutton him stillfurther  and untagging the points of his hose  unbuckling his garters and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermostbones  set him before you in his ultimatum  that is to say  in hisunconditional skeleton but how now  ishmael 
how is it  that you  a mere oarsman in thefishery  pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of thewhale 
did erudite stubb  mounted upon your capstan  deliver lectureson the anatomy of the cetacea  and by help of the windlass  hold up aspecimen rib for exhibition 
explain thyself  ishmael 
can you land afull grown whale on your deck for examination  as a cook dishes aroast pig 
surely not 
a veritable witness have you hitherto been ishmael  but have a care how you seize the privilege of jonah alone the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams  the rafters ridge pole  sleepers  and under pinnings  making up the frame work ofleviathan  and belike of the tallow vats  dairy rooms  butteries  andcheeseries in his bowels i confess  that since jonah  few whalemen have penetrated very farbeneath the skin of the adult whale  nevertheless  i have been blessedwith an opportunity to dissect him in miniature 
in a ship i belongedto  a small cub sperm whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for hispoke or bag  to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons  and for theheads of the lances 
think you i let that chance go  without using myboat hatchet and jack knife  and breaking the seal and reading all thecontents of that young cub and as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in theirgigantic  full grown development  for that rare knowledge i am indebtedto my late royal friend tranquo  king of tranque  one of the arsacides for being at tranque  years ago  when attached to the trading ship deyof algiers  i was invited to spend part of the arsacidean holidays withthe lord of tranque  at his retired palm villa at pupella  a sea sideglen not very far distant from what our sailors called bamboo town  hiscapital among many other fine qualities  my royal friend tranquo  being giftedwith a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu  had broughttogether in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of hispeople could invent  chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices chiselled shells  inlaid spears  costly paddles  aromatic canoes  andall these distributed among whatever natural wonders  thewonder freighted  tribute rendering waves had cast upon his shores chief among these latter was a great sperm whale  which  after anunusually long raging gale  had been found dead and stranded  with hishead against a cocoa nut tree  whose plumage like  tufted droopingsseemed his verdant jet 
when the vast body had at last been stripped ofits fathom deep enfoldings  and the bones become dust dry in the sun then the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen  wherea grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it the ribs were hung with trophies  the vertebræ were carved witharsacidean annals  in strange hieroglyphics  in the skull  the priestskept up an unextinguished aromatic flame  so that the mystic head againsent forth its vapory spout  while  suspended from a bough  theterrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees  like the hair hungsword that so affrighted damocles it was a wondrous sight 
the wood was green as mosses of the icy glen the trees stood high and haughty  feeling their living sap  theindustrious earth beneath was as a weaver s loom  with a gorgeouscarpet on it  whereof the ground vine tendrils formed the warp andwoof  and the living flowers the figures 
all the trees  with all theirladen branches  all the shrubs  and ferns  and grasses  themessage carrying air  all these unceasingly were active 
through thelacings of the leaves  the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weavingthe unwearied verdure 
oh  busy weaver 
unseen weaver  pause  oneword  whither flows the fabric 
what palace may it deck 
wherefore allthese ceaseless toilings 
speak  weaver  stay thy hand  but one singleword with thee 
nay the shuttle flies the figures float from forth theloom  the freshet rushing carpet for ever slides away 
the weaver god he weaves  and by that weaving is he deafened  that he hears no mortalvoice  and by that humming  we  too  who look on the loom are deafened and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speakthrough it 
for even so it is in all material factories 
the spokenwords that are inaudible among the flying spindles  those same wordsare plainly heard without the walls  bursting from the openedcasements 
thereby have villainies been detected 
ah  mortal 
then  beheedful  for so  in all this din of the great world s loom  thysubtlest thinkings may be overheard afar now  amid the green  life restless loom of that arsacidean wood  thegreat  white  worshipped skeleton lay lounging a gigantic idler 
yet as the ever woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed aroundhim  the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver  himself all woven overwith the vines  every month assuming greener  fresher verdure  buthimself a skeleton 
life folded death  death trellised life  the grimgod wived with youthful life  and begat him curly headed glories now  when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale  and saw theskull an altar  and the artificial smoke ascending from where the realjet had issued  i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as anobject of vertu 
he laughed 
but more i marvelled that the priestsshould swear that smoky jet of his was genuine 
to and fro i pacedbefore this skeleton brushed the vines aside broke through the ribs andwith a ball of arsacidean twine  wandered  eddied long amid its manywinding  shaded colonnades and arbours 
but soon my line was out  andfollowing it back  i emerged from the opening where i entered 
i saw noliving thing within  naught was there but bones cutting me a green measuring rod  i once more dived within theskeleton 
from their arrow slit in the skull  the priests perceived metaking the altitude of the final rib   how now   they shouted   dar stthou measure this our god 
that s for us    aye  priests well  how longdo ye make him  then   but hereupon a fierce contest rose among them concerning feet and inches  they cracked each other s sconces withtheir yard sticks the great skull echoed and seizing that lucky chance i quickly concluded my own admeasurements these admeasurements i now propose to set before you 
but first  be itrecorded  that  in this matter  i am not free to utter any fanciedmeasurement i please 
because there are skeleton authorities you canrefer to  to test my accuracy 
there is a leviathanic museum  they tellme  in hull  england  one of the whaling ports of that country  wherethey have some fine specimens of fin backs and other whales 
likewise i have heard that in the museum of manchester  in new hampshire  theyhave what the proprietors call  the only perfect specimen of agreenland or river whale in the united states   moreover  at a place inyorkshire  england  burton constable by name  a certain sir cliffordconstable has in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale  but ofmoderate size  by no means of the full grown magnitude of my friendking tranquo s in both cases  the stranded whales to which these two skeletonsbelonged  were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similargrounds 
king tranquo seizing his because he wanted it  and sirclifford  because he was lord of the seignories of those parts 
sirclifford s whale has been articulated throughout  so that  like a greatchest of drawers  you can open and shut him  in all his bonycavities spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan and swing all day uponhis lower jaw 
locks are to be put upon some of his trap doors andshutters  and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch ofkeys at his side 
sir clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peepat the whispering gallery in the spinal column  threepence to hear theecho in the hollow of his cerebellum  and sixpence for the unrivalledview from his forehead the skeleton dimensions i shall now proceed to set down are copiedverbatim from my right arm  where i had them tattooed  as in my wildwanderings at that period  there was no other secure way of preservingsuch valuable statistics 
but as i was crowded for space  and wishedthe other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i was thencomposing at least  what untattooed parts might remain i did nottrouble myself with the odd inches  nor  indeed  should inches at allenter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale chapter 103 
measurement of the whale s skeleton in the first place  i wish to lay before you a particular  plainstatement  touching the living bulk of this leviathan  whose skeletonwe are briefly to exhibit 
such a statement may prove useful here according to a careful calculation i have made  and which i partly baseupon captain scoresby s estimate  of seventy tons for the largest sizedgreenland whale of sixty feet in length  according to my carefulcalculation  i say  a sperm whale of the largest magnitude  betweeneighty five and ninety feet in length  and something less than fortyfeet in its fullest circumference  such a whale will weigh at leastninety tons  so that  reckoning thirteen men to a ton  he wouldconsiderably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of onethousand one hundred inhabitants think you not then that brains  like yoked cattle  should be put tothis leviathan  to make him at all budge to any landsman s imagination having already in various ways put before you his skull  spout hole jaw  teeth  tail  forehead  fins  and divers other parts  i shall nowsimply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of hisunobstructed bones 
but as the colossal skull embraces so very large aproportion of the entire extent of the skeleton  as it is by far themost complicated part  and as nothing is to be repeated concerning itin this chapter  you must not fail to carry it in your mind  or underyour arm  as we proceed  otherwise you will not gain a complete notionof the general structure we are about to view in length  the sperm whale s skeleton at tranque measured seventy twofeet  so that when fully invested and extended in life  he must havebeen ninety feet long  for in the whale  the skeleton loses about onefifth in length compared with the living body 
of this seventy twofeet  his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet  leaving some fiftyfeet of plain back bone 
attached to this back bone  for something lessthan a third of its length  was the mighty circular basket of ribswhich once enclosed his vitals to me this vast ivory ribbed chest  with the long  unrelieved spine extending far away from it in a straight line  not a little resembledthe hull of a great ship new laid upon the stocks  when only sometwenty of her naked bow ribs are inserted  and the keel is otherwise for the time  but a long  disconnected timber the ribs were ten on a side 
the first  to begin from the neck  wasnearly six feet long  the second  third  and fourth were eachsuccessively longer  till you came to the climax of the fifth  or oneof the middle ribs  which measured eight feet and some inches 
fromthat part  the remaining ribs diminished  till the tenth and last onlyspanned five feet and some inches 
in general thickness  they all borea seemly correspondence to their length 
the middle ribs were the mostarched 
in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to layfootpath bridges over small streams in considering these ribs  i could not but be struck anew with thecircumstance  so variously repeated in this book  that the skeleton ofthe whale is by no means the mould of his invested form 
the largest ofthe tranque ribs  one of the middle ones  occupied that part of thefish which  in life  is greatest in depth 
now  the greatest depth ofthe invested body of this particular whale must have been at leastsixteen feet  whereas  the corresponding rib measured but little morethan eight feet 
so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notionof the living magnitude of that part 
besides  for some way  where inow saw but a naked spine  all that had been once wrapped round withtons of added bulk in flesh  muscle  blood  and bowels 
still more  forthe ample fins  i here saw but a few disordered joints  and in place ofthe weighty and majestic  but boneless flukes  an utter blank how vain and foolish  then  thought i  for timid untravelled man to tryto comprehend aright this wondrous whale  by merely poring over hisdead attenuated skeleton  stretched in this peaceful wood 
only inthe heart of quickest perils  only when within the eddyings of hisangry flukes  only on the profound unbounded sea  can the fullyinvested whale be truly and livingly found out but the spine 
for that  the best way we can consider it is  with acrane  to pile its bones high up on end 
no speedy enterprise 
but nowit s done  it looks much like pompey s pillar there are forty and odd vertebræ in all  which in the skeleton are notlocked together 
they mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on agothic spire  forming solid courses of heavy masonry 
the largest  amiddle one  is in width something less than three feet  and in depthmore than four 
the smallest  where the spine tapers away into thetail  is only two inches in width  and looks something like a whitebilliard ball 
i was told that there were still smaller ones  but theyhad been lost by some little cannibal urchins  the priest s children who had stolen them to play marbles with 
thus we see how that thespine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last intosimple child s play chapter 104 
the fossil whale from his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereonto enlarge  amplify  and generally expatiate 
would you  you could notcompress him 
by good rights he should only be treated of in imperialfolio 
not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail  andthe yards he measures about the waist  only think of the giganticinvolutions of his intestines  where they lie in him like great cablesand hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop deck of aline of battle ship since i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan  it behooves me toapprove myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise  notoverlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood  and spinning himout to the uttermost coil of his bowels 
having already described himin most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities  it nowremains to magnify him in an archæological  fossiliferous  andantediluvian point of view 
applied to any other creature than theleviathan to an ant or a flea such portly terms might justly be deemedunwarrantably grandiloquent 
but when leviathan is the text  the caseis altered 
fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiestwords of the dictionary 
and here be it said  that whenever it has beenconvenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations  i haveinvariably used a huge quarto edition of johnson  expressly purchasedfor that purpose  because that famous lexicographer s uncommon personalbulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale authorlike me one often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject though it may seem but an ordinary one 
how  then  with me  writing ofthis leviathan 
unconsciously my chirography expands into placardcapitals 
give me a condor s quill 
give me vesuvius  crater for aninkstand 
friends  hold my arms 
for in the mere act of penning mythoughts of this leviathan  they weary me  and make me faint with theiroutreaching comprehensiveness of sweep  as if to include the wholecircle of the sciences  and all the generations of whales  and men  andmastodons  past  present  and to come  with all the revolving panoramasof empire on earth  and throughout the whole universe  not excludingits suburbs 
such  and so magnifying  is the virtue of a large andliberal theme 
we expand to its bulk 
to produce a mighty book  youmust choose a mighty theme 
no great and enduring volume can ever bewritten on the flea  though many there be who have tried it ere entering upon the subject of fossil whales  i present mycredentials as a geologist  by stating that in my miscellaneous time ihave been a stone mason  and also a great digger of ditches  canals andwells  wine vaults  cellars  and cisterns of all sorts 
likewise  byway of preliminary  i desire to remind the reader  that while in theearlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters nowalmost completely extinct  the subsequent relics discovered in what arecalled the tertiary formations seem the connecting  or at any rateintercepted links  between the antichronical creatures  and those whoseremote posterity are said to have entered the ark  all the fossilwhales hitherto discovered belong to the tertiary period  which is thelast preceding the superficial formations 
and though none of themprecisely answer to any known species of the present time  they are yetsufficiently akin to them in general respects  to justify their takingrank as cetacean fossils detached broken fossils of pre adamite whales  fragments of their bonesand skeletons  have within thirty years past  at various intervals been found at the base of the alps  in lombardy  in france  in england in scotland  and in the states of louisiana  mississippi  and alabama among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull  which in theyear 1779 was disinterred in the rue dauphine in paris  a short streetopening almost directly upon the palace of the tuileries  and bonesdisinterred in excavating the great docks of antwerp  in napoleon stime 
cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to someutterly unknown leviathanic species but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almostcomplete vast skeleton of an extinct monster  found in the year 1842 on the plantation of judge creagh  in alabama 
the awe strickencredulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of thefallen angels 
the alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile  andbestowed upon it the name of basilosaurus 
but some specimen bones ofit being taken across the sea to owen  the english anatomist  it turnedout that this alleged reptile was a whale  though of a departedspecies 
a significant illustration of the fact  again and againrepeated in this book  that the skeleton of the whale furnishes butlittle clue to the shape of his fully invested body 
so owenrechristened the monster zeuglodon  and in his paper read before thelondon geological society  pronounced it  in substance  one of the mostextraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blottedout of existence when i stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons  skulls  tusks jaws  ribs  and vertebræ  all characterized by partial resemblances tothe existing breeds of sea monsters  but at the same time bearing onthe other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronicalleviathans  their incalculable seniors  i am  by a flood  borne back tothat wondrous period  ere time itself can be said to have begun  fortime began with man 
here saturn s grey chaos rolls over me  and iobtain dim  shuddering glimpses into those polar eternities  whenwedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropics  andin all the 25 000 miles of this world s circumference  not aninhabitable hand s breadth of land was visible 
then the whole worldwas the whale s  and  king of creation  he left his wake along thepresent lines of the andes and the himmalehs 
who can show a pedigreelike leviathan 
ahab s harpoon had shed older blood than the pharaoh s methuselah seems a school boy 
i look round to shake hands with shem 
iam horror struck at this antemosaic  unsourced existence of theunspeakable terrors of the whale  which  having been before all time must needs exist after all humane ages are over but not alone has this leviathan left his pre adamite traces in thestereotype plates of nature  and in limestone and marl bequeathed hisancient bust  but upon egyptian tablets  whose antiquity seems to claimfor them an almost fossiliferous character  we find the unmistakableprint of his fin 
in an apartment of the great temple of denderah  somefifty years ago  there was discovered upon the granite ceiling asculptured and painted planisphere  abounding in centaurs  griffins and dolphins  similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globeof the moderns 
gliding among them  old leviathan swam as of yore  wasthere swimming in that planisphere  centuries before solomon wascradled nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquityof the whale  in his own osseous post diluvian reality  as set down bythe venerable john leo  the old barbary traveller  not far from the sea side  they have a temple  the rafters and beamsof which are made of whale bones  for whales of a monstrous size areoftentimes cast up dead upon that shore 
the common people imagine that by a secret power bestowed by god upon the temple  no whale canpass it without immediate death 
but the truth of the matter is  thaton either side of the temple  there are rocks that shoot two miles intothe sea  and wound the whales when they light upon  em 
they keep awhale s rib of an incredible length for a miracle  which lying upon theground with its convex part uppermost  makes an arch  the head of whichcannot be reached by a man upon a camel s back 
this rib  says johnleo  is said to have layn there a hundred years before i saw it 
theirhistorians affirm  that a prophet who prophesy d of mahomet  came fromthis temple  and some do not stand to assert  that the prophet jonaswas cast forth by the whale at the base of the temple  in this afric temple of the whale i leave you  reader  and if you be anantucketer  and a whaleman  you will silently worship there chapter 105 
does the whale s magnitude diminish  will he perish inasmuch  then  as this leviathan comes floundering down upon us fromthe head waters of the eternities  it may be fitly inquired  whether in the long course of his generations  he has not degenerated from theoriginal bulk of his sires but upon investigation we find  that not only are the whales of thepresent day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains arefound in the tertiary system  embracing a distinct geological periodprior to man   but of the whales found in that tertiary system  thosebelonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlierones of all the pre adamite whales yet exhumed  by far the largest is thealabama one mentioned in the last chapter  and that was less thanseventy feet in length in the skeleton 
whereas  we have already seen that the tape measure gives seventy two feet for the skeleton of alarge sized modern whale 
and i have heard  on whalemen s authority that sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at thetime of capture but may it not be  that while the whales of the present hour are anadvance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods  mayit not be  that since adam s time they have degenerated assuredly  we must conclude so  if we are to credit the accounts ofsuch gentlemen as pliny  and the ancient naturalists generally 
forpliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk  andaldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length ropewalks and thames tunnels of whales 
and even in the days of banks andsolander  cooke s naturalists  we find a danish member of the academyof sciences setting down certain iceland whales  reydan siskur  orwrinkled bellies  at one hundred and twenty yards  that is  threehundred and sixty feet 
and lacépède  the french naturalist  in hiselaborate history of whales  in the very beginning of his work  page3   sets down the right whale at one hundred metres  three hundred andtwenty eight feet 
and this work was published so late as a d  1825 but will any whaleman believe these stories 
the whale of to day isas big as his ancestors in pliny s time 
and if ever i go where plinyis  i  a whaleman  more than he was   will make bold to tell him so because i cannot understand how it is  that while the egyptian mummiesthat were buried thousands of years before even pliny was born  do notmeasure so much in their coffins as a modern kentuckian in his socks and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldestegyptian and nineveh tablets  by the relative proportions in which theyare drawn  just as plainly prove that the high bred  stall fed  prizecattle of smithfield  not only equal  but far exceed in magnitude thefattest of pharaoh s fat kine  in the face of all this  i will notadmit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated but still another inquiry remains  one often agitated by the morerecondite nantucketers 
whether owing to the almost omniscientlook outs at the mast heads of the whale ships  now penetrating eventhrough behring s straits  and into the remotest secret drawers andlockers of the world  and the thousand harpoons and lances darted alongall continental coasts  the moot point is  whether leviathan can longendure so wide a chase  and so remorseless a havoc  whether he must notat last be exterminated from the waters  and the last whale  like thelast man  smoke his last pipe  and then himself evaporate in the finalpuff comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo which  not forty years ago  overspread by tens of thousands theprairies of illinois and missouri  and shook their iron manes andscowled with their thunder clotted brows upon the sites of populousriver capitals  where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollaran inch  in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seemfurnished  to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedyextinction but you must look at this matter in every light 
though so short aperiod ago not a good lifetime the census of the buffalo in illinoisexceeded the census of men now in london  and though at the present daynot one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region  and though thecause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man  yet the fardifferent nature of the whale hunt peremptorily forbids so ingloriousan end to the leviathan 
forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whalesfor forty eight months think they have done extremely well  and thankgod  if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish 
whereas  in thedays of the old canadian and indian hunters and trappers of the west when the far west  in whose sunset suns still rise  was a wildernessand a virgin  the same number of moccasined men  for the same number ofmonths  mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships  would have slainnot forty  but forty thousand and more buffaloes  a fact that  if needwere  could be statistically stated nor  considered aright  does it seem any argument in favour of thegradual extinction of the sperm whale  for example  that in formeryears  the latter part of the last century  say  these leviathans  insmall pods  were encountered much oftener than at present  and  inconsequence  the voyages were not so prolonged  and were also much moreremunerative 
because  as has been elsewhere noticed  those whales influenced by some views to safety  now swim the seas in immensecaravans  so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries  yokes and pods  and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast butwidely separated  unfrequent armies 
that is all 
and equallyfallacious seems the conceit  that because the so called whale bonewhales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding withthem  hence that species also is declining 
for they are only beingdriven from promontory to cape  and if one coast is no longer enlivenedwith their jets  then  be sure  some other and remoter strand has beenvery recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle furthermore  concerning these last mentioned leviathans  they have twofirm fortresses  which  in all human probability  will for ever remainimpregnable 
and as upon the invasion of their valleys  the frostyswiss have retreated to their mountains  so  hunted from the savannasand glades of the middle seas  the whale bone whales can at last resortto their polar citadels  and diving under the ultimate glassy barriersand walls there  come up among icy fields and floes  and in a charmedcircle of everlasting december  bid defiance to all pursuit from man but as perhaps fifty of these whale bone whales are harpooned for onecachalot  some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that thispositive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions but though for some time past a number of these whales  not less than13 000  have been annually slain on the nor  west coast by theamericans alone  yet there are considerations which render even thiscircumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in thismatter natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousnessof the more enormous creatures of the globe  yet what shall we say toharto  the historian of goa  when he tells us that at one hunting theking of siam took 4 000 elephants  that in those regions elephants arenumerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes 
and there seemsno reason to doubt that if these elephants  which have now been huntedfor thousands of years  by semiramis  by porus  by hannibal  and by allthe successive monarchs of the east if they still survive there ingreat numbers  much more may the great whale outlast all hunting  sincehe has a pasture to expatiate in  which is precisely twice as large asall asia  both americas  europe and africa  new holland  and all theisles of the sea combined moreover  we are to consider  that from the presumed great longevity ofwhales  their probably attaining the age of a century and more therefore at any one period of time  several distinct adult generationsmust be contemporary 
and what that is  we may soon gain some idea of by imagining all the grave yards  cemeteries  and family vaults ofcreation yielding up the live bodies of all the men  women  andchildren who were alive seventy five years ago  and adding thiscountless host to the present human population of the globe wherefore  for all these things  we account the whale immortal in hisspecies  however perishable in his individuality 
he swam the seasbefore the continents broke water  he once swam over the site of thetuileries  and windsor castle  and the kremlin 
in noah s flood hedespised noah s ark  and if ever the world is to be again flooded  likethe netherlands  to kill off its rats  then the eternal whale willstill survive  and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorialflood  spout his frothed defiance to the skies chapter 106 
ahab s leg the precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuelenderby of london  had not been unattended with some small violence tohis own person 
he had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of hisboat that his ivory leg had received a half splintering shock 
and whenafter gaining his own deck  and his own pivot hole there  he sovehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman  itwas  as ever  something about his not steering inflexibly enough  then  the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist andwrench  that though it still remained entire  and to all appearanceslusty  yet ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy and  indeed  it seemed small matter for wonder  that for all hispervading  mad recklessness  ahab did at times give careful heed to thecondition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood 
for it had notbeen very long prior to the pequod s sailing from nantucket  that hehad been found one night lying prone upon the ground  and insensible by some unknown  and seemingly inexplicable  unimaginable casualty  hisivory limb having been so violently displaced  that it had stake wisesmitten  and all but pierced his groin  nor was it without extremedifficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured nor  at the time  had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind  that allthe anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue ofa former woe  and he too plainly seemed to see  that as the mostpoisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably asthe sweetest songster of the grove  so  equally with every felicity all miserable events do naturally beget their like 
yea  more thanequally  thought ahab  since both the ancestry and posterity of griefgo further than the ancestry and posterity of joy 
for  not to hint ofthis  that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings  thatwhile some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to themfor the other world  but  on the contrary  shall be followed by thejoy childlessness of all hell s despair  whereas  some guilty mortalmiseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternallyprogressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave  not at all to hint ofthis  there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of thething 
for  thought ahab  while even the highest earthly felicitiesever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them  but  atbottom  all heartwoes  a mystic significance  and  in some men  anarchangelic grandeur  so do their diligent tracings out not belie theobvious deduction 
to trail the genealogies of these high mortalmiseries  carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of thegods  so that  in the face of all the glad  hay making suns  and softcymballing  round harvest moons  we must needs give in to this  thatthe gods themselves are not for ever glad 
the ineffaceable  sadbirth mark in the brow of man  is but the stamp of sorrow in thesigners unwittingly here a secret has been divulged  which perhaps might moreproperly  in set way  have been disclosed before 
with many otherparticulars concerning ahab  always had it remained a mystery to some why it was  that for a certain period  both before and after thesailing of the pequod  he had hidden himself away with suchgrand lama like exclusiveness  and  for that one interval  soughtspeechless refuge  as it were  among the marble senate of the dead captain peleg s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no meansadequate  though  indeed  as touching all ahab s deeper part  everyrevelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatorylight 
but  in the end  it all came out  this one matter did  at least that direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness 
andnot only this  but to that ever contracting  dropping circle ashore who  for any reason  possessed the privilege of a less banned approachto him  to that timid circle the above hinted casualty remaining  as itdid  moodily unaccounted for by ahab invested itself with terrors  notentirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails 
so that through their zeal for him  they had all conspired  so far as in themlay  to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others  and hence itwas  that not till a considerable interval had elapsed  did ittranspire upon the pequod s decks but be all this as it may  let the unseen  ambiguous synod in the air or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire  have to do or notwith earthly ahab  yet  in this present matter of his leg  he tookplain practical procedures  he called the carpenter and when that functionary appeared before him  he bade him withoutdelay set about making a new leg  and directed the mates to see himsupplied with all the studs and joists of jaw ivory  sperm whale  whichhad thus far been accumulated on the voyage  in order that a carefulselection of the stoutest  clearest grained stuff might be secured this done  the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed thatnight  and to provide all the fittings for it  independent of thosepertaining to the distrusted one in use 
moreover  the ship s forge wasordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold  and to accelerate the affair  the blacksmith was commanded to proceed atonce to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed chapter 107 
the carpenter seat thyself sultanically among the moons of saturn  and take highabstracted man alone  and he seems a wonder  a grandeur  and a woe 
butfrom the same point  take mankind in mass  and for the most part  theyseem a mob of unnecessary duplicates  both contemporary and hereditary but most humble though he was  and far from furnishing an example ofthe high  humane abstraction  the pequod s carpenter was no duplicate hence  he now comes in person on this stage like all sea going ship carpenters  and more especially those belongingto whaling vessels  he was  to a certain off handed  practical extent alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to hisown  the carpenter s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunkof all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do withwood as an auxiliary material 
but  besides the application to him ofthe generic remark above  this carpenter of the pequod was singularlyefficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continuallyrecurring in a large ship  upon a three or four years  voyage  inuncivilized and far distant seas 
for not to speak of his readiness inordinary duties  repairing stove boats  sprung spars  reforming theshape of clumsy bladed oars  inserting bull s eyes in the deck  or newtree nails in the side planks  and other miscellaneous matters moredirectly pertaining to his special business  he was moreoverunhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes  bothuseful and capricious the one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold was his vice bench  a long rude ponderous table furnished with severalvices  of different sizes  and both of iron and of wood 
at all timesexcept when whales were alongside  this bench was securely lashedathwartships against the rear of the try works a belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole the carpenter claps it into one of his ever ready vices  andstraightway files it smaller

a sailor takes a fancy to wear shark bone ear rings  thecarpenter drills his ears 
another has the toothache  the carpenter outpincers  and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcludedoperation  whirling round the handle of his wooden vice  the carpentersigns him to clap his jaw in that  if he would have him draw the tooth thus  this carpenter was prepared at all points  and alike indifferentand without respect in all 
teeth he accounted bits of ivory  heads hedeemed but top blocks  men themselves he lightly held for capstans 
butwhile now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and withsuch liveliness of expertness in him  too  all this would seem to arguesome uncommon vivacity of intelligence 
but not precisely so 
fornothing was this man more remarkable  than for a certain impersonalstolidity as it were  impersonal  i say  for it so shaded off into thesurrounding infinite of things  that it seemed one with the generalstolidity discernible in the whole visible world  which whilepauselessly active in uncounted modes  still eternally holds its peace and ignores you  though you dig foundations for cathedrals 
yet wasthis half horrible stolidity in him  involving  too  as it appeared  anall ramifying heartlessness  yet was it oddly dashed at times  with anold  crutch like  antediluvian  wheezing humorousness  not unstreakednow and then with a certain grizzled wittiness  such as might haveserved to pass the time during the midnight watch on the beardedforecastle of noah s ark 
was it that this old carpenter had been alife long wanderer  whose much rolling  to and fro  not only hadgathered no moss  but what is more  had rubbed off whatever smalloutward clingings might have originally pertained to him 
he was astript abstract  an unfractioned integral  uncompromised as a new bornbabe  living without premeditated reference to this world or the next you might almost say  that this strange uncompromisedness in himinvolved a sort of unintelligence  for in his numerous trades  he didnot seem to work so much by reason or by instinct  or simply because hehad been tutored to it  or by any intermixture of all these  even oruneven  but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb  spontaneous literalprocess 
he was a pure manipulator  his brain  if he had ever had one must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers 
he waslike one of those unreasoning but still highly useful  multum inparvo  sheffield contrivances  assuming the exterior though a littleswelled of a common pocket knife  but containing  not only blades ofvarious sizes  but also screw drivers  cork screws  tweezers  awls pens  rulers  nail filers  countersinkers 
so  if his superiors wantedto use the carpenter for a screw driver  all they had to do was to openthat part of him  and the screw was fast  or if for tweezers  take himup by the legs  and there they were yet  as previously hinted  this omnitooled  open and shut carpenter was  after all  no mere machine of an automaton 
if he did not have acommon soul in him  he had a subtle something that somehow anomalouslydid its duty 
what that was  whether essence of quicksilver  or a fewdrops of hartshorn  there is no telling 
but there it was  and there ithad abided for now some sixty years or more 
and this it was  this sameunaccountable  cunning life principle in him  this it was  that kepthim a great part of the time soliloquizing  but only like anunreasoning wheel  which also hummingly soliloquizes  or rather  hisbody was a sentry box and this soliloquizer on guard there  and talkingall the time to keep himself awake chapter 108

that is hard which should be soft and that is soft which should be hard 
so we go  who file old jaws andshinbones 
let s try another 
aye  now  this works better  sneezes  halloa  this bone dust is  sneezes  why it s  sneezes  yes it s sneezes  bless my soul  it won t let me speak 
this is what an oldfellow gets now for working in dead lumber 
saw a live tree  and youdon t get this dust  amputate a live bone  and you don t get it sneezes  
come  come  you old smut  there  bear a hand  and let shave that ferule and buckle screw  i ll be ready for them presently lucky now  sneezes  there s no knee joint to make  that might puzzlea little  but a mere shinbone why it s easy as making hop poles  only ishould like to put a good finish on 
time  time  if i but only had thetime  i could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever  sneezes scraped to a lady in a parlor 
those buckskin legs and calves of legsi ve seen in shop windows wouldn t compare at all 
they soak water they do  and of course get rheumatic  and have to be doctored sneezes  with washes and lotions  just like live legs 
there  beforei saw it off  now  i must call his old mogulship  and see whether thelength will be all right  too short  if anything  i guess 
that sthe heel  we are in luck  here he comes  or it s somebody else  that scertain ahab  advancing  
 during the ensuing scene  the carpenter continuessneezing at times  well  manmaker just in time  sir 
if the captain pleases  i will now mark the length let me measure  sir measured for a leg 
well  it s not the first time 
about it there  keep thy finger on it 
this is a cogent vice thou hast here carpenter  let me feel its grip once 
so  so  it does pinch some oh  sir  it will break bones beware  beware no fear  i like a good grip  i like to feel something in this slipperyworld that can hold  man 
what s prometheus about there  theblacksmith  i mean what s he about he must be forging the buckle screw  sir  now right 
it s a partnership  he supplies the muscle part 
he makes afierce red flame there aye  sir  he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work um m 
so he must 
i do deem it now a most meaning thing  that that oldgreek  prometheus  who made men  they say  should have been ablacksmith  and animated them with fire  for what s made in fire mustproperly belong to fire  and so hell s probable 
how the soot flies this must be the remainder the greek made the africans of 
carpenter when he s through with that buckle  tell him to forge a pair of steelshoulder blades  there s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack sir hold  while prometheus is about it  i ll order a complete man after adesirable pattern 
imprimis  fifty feet high in his socks  then  chestmodelled after the thames tunnel  then  legs with roots to  em  to stayin one place  then  arms three feet through the wrist  no heart at all brass forehead  and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains  and letme see shall i order eyes to see outwards 
no  but put a sky light ontop of his head to illuminate inwards 
there  take the order  and away now  what s he speaking about  and who s he speaking to  i should liketo know 
shall i keep standing here 
 aside   tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome  here s one 
no no  no  i must have a lantern ho  ho 
that s it  hey 
here are two  sir  one will serve my turn what art thou thrusting that thief catcher into my face for  man thrusted light is worse than presented pistols i thought  sir  that you spoke to carpenter carpenter 
why that s but no  a very tidy  and  i may say  an extremelygentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here  carpenter  or would stthou rather work in clay sir  clay 
clay  sir 
that s mud  we leave clay to ditchers  sir the fellow s impious 
what art thou sneezing about bone is rather dusty  sir take the hint  then  and when thou art dead  never bury thyself underliving people s noses sir  oh 
ah  i guess so  yes oh  dear look ye  carpenter  i dare say thou callest thyself a right goodworkmanlike workman  eh 
well  then  will it speak thoroughly well forthy work  if  when i come to mount this leg thou makest  i shallnevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it  thatis  carpenter  my old lost leg  the flesh and blood one  i mean 
canstthou not drive that old adam away truly  sir  i begin to understand somewhat now 
yes  i have heardsomething curious on that score  sir  how that a dismasted man neverentirely loses the feeling of his old spar  but it will be stillpricking him at times 
may i humbly ask if it be really so  sir it is  man 
look  put thy live leg here in the place where mine oncewas  so  now  here is only one distinct leg to the eye  yet two to thesoul 
where thou feelest tingling life  there  exactly there  there toa hair  do i  is t a riddle i should humbly call it a poser  sir hist  then 
how dost thou know that some entire  living  thinking thingmay not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely wherethou now standest  aye  and standing there in thy spite 
in thy mostsolitary hours  then  dost thou not fear eavesdroppers 
hold  don tspeak 
and if i still feel the smart of my crushed leg  though it benow so long dissolved  then  why mayst not thou  carpenter  feel thefiery pains of hell for ever  and without a body 
hah good lord 
truly  sir  if it comes to that  i must calculate overagain  i think i didn t carry a small figure  sir look ye  pudding heads should never grant premises  how long before theleg is done perhaps an hour  sir bungle away at it then  and bring it to me  turns to go  
oh  life here i am  proud as greek god  and yet standing debtor to thisblockhead for a bone to stand on 
cursed be that mortalinter indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers 
i would be freeas air  and i m down in the whole world s books 
i am so rich  i couldhave given bid for bid with the wealthiest prætorians at the auction ofthe roman empire  which was the world s   and yet i owe for the fleshin the tongue i brag with 
by heavens 
i ll get a crucible  and intoit  and dissolve myself down to one small  compendious vertebra 
so carpenter  resuming his work  well  well  well 
stubb knows him best of all  and stubb always sayshe s queer  says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer he s queer  says stubb  he s queer queer  queer  and keeps dinning itinto mr  starbuck all the time queer sir queer  queer  very queer 
andhere s his leg 
yes  now that i think of it  here s his bedfellow 
hasa stick of whale s jaw bone for a wife 
and this is his leg  he llstand on this 
what was that now about one leg standing in threeplaces  and all three places standing in one hell how was that 
idon t wonder he looked so scornful at me 
i m a sort ofstrange thoughted sometimes  they say  but that s only haphazard like then  a short  little old body like me  should never undertake to wadeout into deep waters with tall  heron built captains  the water chucksyou under the chin pretty quick  and there s a great cry forlife boats 
and here s the heron s leg 
long and slim  sure enough now  for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime  and that must bebecause they use them mercifully  as a tender hearted old lady uses herroly poly old coach horses 
but ahab  oh he s a hard driver 
look driven one leg to death  and spavined the other for life  and now wearsout bone legs by the cord 
halloa  there  you smut 
bear a hand therewith those screws  and let s finish it before the resurrection fellowcomes a calling with his horn for all legs  true or false  asbrewery men go round collecting old beer barrels  to fill  em up again what a leg this is 
it looks like a real live leg  filed down tonothing but the core  he ll be standing on this to morrow  he ll betaking altitudes on it 
i almost forgot the little oval slate smoothed ivory  where he figures up the latitude 
so  so  chisel  file and sand paper  now chapter 109 
ahab and starbuck in the cabin according to usage they were pumping the ship next morning  and lo 
noinconsiderable oil came up with the water  the casks below must havesprung a bad leak 
much concern was shown  and starbuck went down intothe cabin to report this unfavourable affair 
  in sperm whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board  itis a regular semi weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold  anddrench the casks with sea water  which afterwards  at varyingintervals  is removed by the ship s pumps 
hereby the casks are soughtto be kept damply tight  while by the changed character of thewithdrawn water  the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in theprecious cargo now  from the south and west the pequod was drawing nigh to formosa andthe bashee isles  between which lies one of the tropical outlets fromthe china waters into the pacific 
and so starbuck found ahab with ageneral chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him  andanother separate one representing the long eastern coasts of thejapanese islands niphon  matsmai  and sikoke 
with his snow white newivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table  and with a longpruning hook of a jack knife in his hand  the wondrous old man  withhis back to the gangway door  was wrinkling his brow  and tracing hisold courses again  who s there   hearing the footstep at the door  but not turning roundto it 
 on deck 
begone   captain ahab mistakes  it is i 
the oil in the hold is leaking  sir we must up burtons and break out   up burtons and break out 
now that we are nearing japan  heave to herefor a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops   either do that  sir  or waste in one day more oil than we may makegood in a year 
what we come twenty thousand miles to get is worthsaving  sir   so it is  so it is  if we get it   i was speaking of the oil in the hold  sir   and i was not speaking or thinking of that at all 
let itleak 
i m all aleak myself 
leaks in leaks 
not only full of leakycasks  but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship  and that s a farworse plight than the pequod s  man 
yet i don t stop to plug my leak for who can find it in the deep loaded hull  or how hope to plug it even if found  in this life s howling gale 
i ll not have theburtons hoisted   what will the owners say  sir   let the owners stand on nantucket beach and outyell the typhoons 
whatcares ahab 
owners  owners 
thou art always prating to me  starbuck about those miserly owners  as if the owners were my conscience 
butlook ye  the only real owner of anything is its commander  and hark ye my conscience is in this ship s keel  on deck   captain ahab   said the reddening mate  moving further into the cabin with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almostseemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outwardmanifestation of itself  but within also seemed more than halfdistrustful of itself   a better man than i might well pass over inthee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man  aye  and ina happier  captain ahab   devils 
dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me  ondeck   nay  sir  not yet  i do entreat 
and i do dare  sir to be forbearing shall we not understand each other better than hitherto  captain ahab  ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack  forming part of mostsouth sea men s cabin furniture   and pointing it towards starbuck exclaimed   there is one god that is lord over the earth  and onecaptain that is lord over the pequod  on deck  for an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate  and his fiery cheeks you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze ofthe levelled tube 
but  mastering his emotion  he half calmly rose  andas he quitted the cabin  paused for an instant and said   thou hastoutraged  not insulted me  sir  but for that i ask thee not to bewareof starbuck  thou wouldst but laugh  but let ahab beware of ahab beware of thyself  old man   he waxes brave  but nevertheless obeys  most careful bravery that  murmured ahab  as starbuck disappeared 
 what s that he said ahabbeware of ahab there s something there   then unconsciously using themusket for a staff  with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the littlecabin  but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed  andreturning the gun to the rack  he went to the deck  thou art but too good a fellow  starbuck   he said lowly to the mate then raising his voice to the crew   furl the t gallant sails  andclose reef the top sails  fore and aft  back the main yard  up burton and break out in the main hold  it were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was  that as respectingstarbuck  ahab thus acted 
it may have been a flash of honesty in him or mere prudential policy which  under the circumstance  imperiouslyforbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection  however transient in the important chief officer of his ship 
however it was  his orderswere executed  and the burtons were hoisted chapter 110 
queequeg in his coffin upon searching  it was found that the casks last struck into the holdwere perfectly sound  and that the leak must be further off 
so  itbeing calm weather  they broke out deeper and deeper  disturbing theslumbers of the huge ground tier butts  and from that black midnightsending those gigantic moles into the daylight above 
so deep did theygo  and so ancient  and corroded  and weedy the aspect of the lowermostpuncheons  that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner stonecask containing coins of captain noah  with copies of the postedplacards  vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood tierce after tierce  too  of water  and bread  and beef  and shooks ofstaves  and iron bundles of hoops  were hoisted out  till at last thepiled decks were hard to get about  and the hollow hull echoed underfoot  as if you were treading over empty catacombs  and reeled androlled in the sea like an air freighted demijohn 
top heavy was theship as a dinnerless student with all aristotle in his head 
well wasit that the typhoons did not visit them then now  at this time it was that my poor pagan companion  and fastbosom friend  queequeg  was seized with a fever  which brought him nighto his endless end be it said  that in this vocation of whaling  sinecures are unknown dignity and danger go hand in hand  till you get to be captain  thehigher you rise the harder you toil 
so with poor queequeg  who  asharpooneer  must not only face all the rage of the living whale  but aswe have elsewhere seen mount his dead back in a rolling sea  andfinally descend into the gloom of the hold  and bitterly sweating allday in that subterraneous confinement  resolutely manhandle theclumsiest casks and see to their stowage 
to be short  among whalemen the harpooneers are the holders  so called poor queequeg 
when the ship was about half disembowelled  you shouldhave stooped over the hatchway  and peered down upon him there  where stripped to his woollen drawers  the tattooed savage was crawling aboutamid that dampness and slime  like a green spotted lizard at the bottomof a well 
and a well  or an ice house  it somehow proved to him  poorpagan  where  strange to say  for all the heat of his sweatings  hecaught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever  and at last  aftersome days  suffering  laid him in his hammock  close to the very sillof the door of death 
how he wasted and wasted away in those fewlong lingering days  till there seemed but little left of him but hisframe and tattooing 
but as all else in him thinned  and hischeek bones grew sharper  his eyes  nevertheless  seemed growing fullerand fuller  they became of a strange softness of lustre  and mildly butdeeply looked out at you there from his sickness  a wondrous testimonyto that immortal health in him which could not die  or be weakened 
andlike circles on the water  which  as they grow fainter  expand  so hiseyes seemed rounding and rounding  like the rings of eternity 
an awethat cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side ofthis waning savage  and saw as strange things in his face  as anybeheld who were bystanders when zoroaster died 
for whatever is trulywondrous and fearful in man  never yet was put into words or books 
andthe drawing near of death  which alike levels all  alike impresses allwith a last revelation  which only an author from the dead couldadequately tell 
so that let us say it again no dying chaldee or greekhad higher and holier thoughts than those  whose mysterious shades yousaw creeping over the face of poor queequeg  as he quietly lay in hisswaying hammock  and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to hisfinal rest  and the ocean s invisible flood tide lifted him higher andhigher towards his destined heaven not a man of the crew but gave him up  and  as for queequeg himself what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour heasked 
he called one to him in the grey morning watch  when the day wasjust breaking  and taking his hand  said that while in nantucket he hadchanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood  like the richwar wood of his native isle  and upon inquiry  he had learned that allwhalemen who died in nantucket  were laid in those same dark canoes and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him  for it wasnot unlike the custom of his own race  who  after embalming a deadwarrior  stretched him out in his canoe  and so left him to be floatedaway to the starry archipelagoes  for not only do they believe that thestars are isles  but that far beyond all visible horizons  their ownmild  uncontinented seas  interflow with the blue heavens  and so formthe white breakers of the milky way 
he added  that he shuddered at thethought of being buried in his hammock  according to the usualsea custom  tossed like something vile to the death devouring sharks no  he desired a canoe like those of nantucket  all the more congenialto him  being a whaleman  that like a whale boat these coffin canoeswere without a keel  though that involved but uncertain steering  andmuch lee way adown the dim ages now  when this strange circumstance was made known aft  the carpenterwas at once commanded to do queequeg s bidding  whatever it mightinclude 
there was some heathenish  coffin coloured old lumber aboard which  upon a long previous voyage  had been cut from the aboriginalgroves of the lackaday islands  and from these dark planks the coffinwas recommended to be made 
no sooner was the carpenter apprised of theorder  than taking his rule  he forthwith with all the indifferentpromptitude of his character  proceeded into the forecastle and tookqueequeg s measure with great accuracy  regularly chalking queequeg sperson as he shifted the rule  ah 
poor fellow 
he ll have to die now   ejaculated the long islandsailor going to his vice bench  the carpenter for convenience sake and generalreference  now transferringly measured on it the exact length thecoffin was to be  and then made the transfer permanent by cutting twonotches at its extremities 
this done  he marshalled the planks and histools  and to work when the last nail was driven  and the lid duly planed and fitted  helightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it  inquiringwhether they were ready for it yet in that direction overhearing the indignant but half humorous cries with which the peopleon deck began to drive the coffin away  queequeg  to every one sconsternation  commanded that the thing should be instantly brought tohim  nor was there any denying him  seeing that  of all mortals  somedying men are the most tyrannical  and certainly  since they willshortly trouble us so little for evermore  the poor fellows ought to beindulged leaning over in his hammock  queequeg long regarded the coffin with anattentive eye 
he then called for his harpoon  had the wooden stockdrawn from it  and then had the iron part placed in the coffin alongwith one of the paddles of his boat 
all by his own request  also biscuits were then ranged round the sides within  a flask of freshwater was placed at the head  and a small bag of woody earth scraped upin the hold at the foot  and a piece of sail cloth being rolled up fora pillow  queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed  thathe might make trial of its comforts  if any it had 
he lay withoutmoving a few minutes  then told one to go to his bag and bring out hislittle god  yojo 
then crossing his arms on his breast with yojobetween  he called for the coffin lid  hatch he called it  to be placedover him 
the head part turned over with a leather hinge  and there layqueequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance inview 
 rarmai   it will do  it is easy   he murmured at last  andsigned to be replaced in his hammock but ere this was done  pip  who had been slily hovering near by allthis while  drew nigh to him where he lay  and with soft sobbings  tookhim by the hand  in the other  holding his tambourine  poor rover 
will ye never have done with all this weary roving 
wherego ye now 
but if the currents carry ye to those sweet antilles wherethe beaches are only beat with water lilies  will ye do one littleerrand for me 
seek out one pip  who s now been missing long  i thinkhe s in those far antilles 
if ye find him  then comfort him  for hemust be very sad  for look 
he s left his tambourine behind  i foundit 
rig a dig  dig  dig 
now  queequeg  die  and i ll beat ye yourdying march   i have heard   murmured starbuck  gazing down the scuttle   that inviolent fevers  men  all ignorance  have talked in ancient tongues  andthat when the mystery is probed  it turns out always that in theirwholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spokenin their hearing by some lofty scholars 
so  to my fond faith  poorpip  in this strange sweetness of his lunacy  brings heavenly vouchersof all our heavenly homes 
where learned he that  but there  hark 
hespeaks again  but more wildly now   form two and two 
let s make a general of him 
ho  where s hisharpoon 
lay it across here  rig a dig  dig  dig 
oh for a gamecock now to sit upon his head and crow 
queequeg dies game  mind yethat  queequeg dies game  take ye good heed of that  queequeg diesgame 
i say  game  game  game 
but base little pip  he died a coward died all a shiver  out upon pip 
hark ye  if ye find pip  tell all theantilles he s a runaway  a coward  a coward  a coward 
tell them hejumped from a whale boat 
i d never beat my tambourine over base pip and hail him general  if he were once more dying here 
no  no 
shameupon all cowards shame upon them 
let  em go drown like pip  thatjumped from a whale boat 
shame  during all this  queequeg lay with closed eyes  as if in a dream 
pipwas led away  and the sick man was replaced in his hammock but now that he had apparently made every preparation for death  nowthat his coffin was proved a good fit  queequeg suddenly rallied  soonthere seemed no need of the carpenter s box  and thereupon  when someexpressed their delighted surprise  he  in substance  said  that thecause of his sudden convalescence was this  at a critical moment  hehad just recalled a little duty ashore  which he was leaving undone and therefore had changed his mind about dying  he could not die yet he averred 
they asked him  then  whether to live or die was a matterof his own sovereign will and pleasure 
he answered  certainly 
in aword  it was queequeg s conceit  that if a man made up his mind tolive  mere sickness could not kill him  nothing but a whale  or a gale or some violent  ungovernable  unintelligent destroyer of that sort now  there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized that while a sick  civilized man may be six months convalescing generally speaking  a sick savage is almost half well again in a day so  in good time my queequeg gained strength  and at length aftersitting on the windlass for a few indolent days  but eating with avigorous appetite  he suddenly leaped to his feet  threw out his armsand legs  gave himself a good stretching  yawned a little bit  and thenspringing into the head of his hoisted boat  and poising a harpoon pronounced himself fit for a fight with a wild whimsiness  he now used his coffin for a sea chest  andemptying into it his canvas bag of clothes  set them in order there many spare hours he spent  in carving the lid with all manner ofgrotesque figures and drawings  and it seemed that hereby he wasstriving  in his rude way  to copy parts of the twisted tattooing onhis body 
and this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophetand seer of his island  who  by those hieroglyphic marks  had writtenout on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth  and amystical treatise on the art of attaining truth  so that queequeg inhis own proper person was a riddle to unfold  a wondrous work in onevolume  but whose mysteries not even himself could read  though his ownlive heart beat against them  and these mysteries were thereforedestined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereonthey were inscribed  and so be unsolved to the last 
and this thoughtit must have been which suggested to ahab that wild exclamation of his when one morning turning away from surveying poor queequeg  oh devilish tantalization of the gods  chapter 111

thus this mysterious  divinepacific zones the world s whole bulk about  makes all coasts one bay toit  seems the tide beating heart of earth 
lifted by those eternalswells  you needs must own the seductive god  bowing your head to pan but few thoughts of pan stirred ahab s brain  as standing like an ironstatue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging  with onenostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the bashee isles in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking   and with the otherconsciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea  that sea inwhich the hated white whale must even then be swimming

the blacksmith availing himself of the mild  summer cool weather that now reigned inthese latitudes  and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuitsshortly to be anticipated  perth  the begrimed  blistered oldblacksmith  had not removed his portable forge to the hold again  afterconcluding his contributory work for ahab s leg  but still retained iton deck  fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast  being now almostincessantly invoked by the headsmen  and harpooneers  and bowsmen to dosome little job for them  altering  or repairing  or new shaping theirvarious weapons and boat furniture 
often he would be surrounded by aneager circle  all waiting to be served  holding boat spades pike heads  harpoons  and lances  and jealously watching his everysooty movement  as he toiled 
nevertheless  this old man s was apatient hammer wielded by a patient arm 
no murmur  no impatience  nopetulance did come from him 
silent  slow  and solemn  bowing overstill further his chronically broken back  he toiled away  as if toilwere life itself  and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beatingof his heart 
and so it was  most miserable a peculiar walk in this old man  a certain slight but painful appearingyawing in his gait  had at an early period of the voyage excited thecuriosity of the mariners 
and to the importunity of their persistedquestionings he had finally given in  and so it came to pass that everyone now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate belated  and not innocently  one bitter winter s midnight  on the roadrunning between two country towns  the blacksmith half stupidly feltthe deadly numbness stealing over him  and sought refuge in a leaning dilapidated barn 
the issue was  the loss of the extremities of bothfeet 
out of this revelation  part by part  at last came out the fouracts of the gladness  and the one long  and as yet uncatastrophiedfifth act of the grief of his life s drama he was an old man  who  at the age of nearly sixty  had postponedlyencountered that thing in sorrow s technicals called ruin 
he had beenan artisan of famed excellence  and with plenty to do  owned a houseand garden  embraced a youthful  daughter like  loving wife  and threeblithe  ruddy children  every sunday went to a cheerful looking church planted in a grove 
but one night  under cover of darkness  and furtherconcealed in a most cunning disguisement  a desperate burglar slid intohis happy home  and robbed them all of everything 
and darker yet totell  the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar intohis family s heart 
it was the bottle conjuror 
upon the opening ofthat fatal cork  forth flew the fiend  and shrivelled up his home 
now for prudent  most wise  and economic reasons  the blacksmith s shop wasin the basement of his dwelling  but with a separate entrance to it  sothat always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with nounhappy nervousness  but with vigorous pleasure  to the stout ringingof her young armed old husband s hammer  whose reverberations  muffledby passing through the floors and walls  came up to her  not unsweetly in her nursery  and so  to stout labor s iron lullaby  the blacksmith sinfants were rocked to slumber oh  woe on woe 
oh  death  why canst thou not sometimes be timely hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin cameupon him  then had the young widow had a delicious grief  and herorphans a truly venerable  legendary sire to dream of in their afteryears  and all of them a care killing competency 
but death pluckeddown some virtuous elder brother  on whose whistling daily toil solelyhung the responsibilities of some other family  and left the worse thanuseless old man standing  till the hideous rot of life should make himeasier to harvest why tell the whole

the forge with matted beard  and swathed in a bristling shark skin apron  aboutmid day  perth was standing between his forge and anvil  the latterplaced upon an iron wood log  with one hand holding a pike head in thecoals  and with the other at his forge s lungs  when captain ahab camealong  carrying in his hand a small rusty looking leathern bag 
whileyet a little distance from the forge  moody ahab paused  till at last perth  withdrawing his iron from the fire  began hammering it upon theanvil the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights some of which flew close to ahab  are these thy mother carey s chickens  perth 
they are always flyingin thy wake  birds of good omen  too  but not to all  look here  theyburn  but thou thou liv st among them without a scorch   because i am scorched all over  captain ahab   answered perth  restingfor a moment on his hammer   i am past scorching  not easily can stthou scorch a scar   well  well  no more 
thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly  sanely woefulto me 
in no paradise myself  i am impatient of all misery in othersthat is not mad 
thou should st go mad  blacksmith  say  why dost thounot go mad 
how can st thou endure without being mad 
do the heavensyet hate thee  that thou can st not go mad  what wert thou makingthere   welding an old pike head  sir  there were seams and dents in it   and can st thou make it all smooth again  blacksmith  after such hardusage as it had   i think so  sir   and i suppose thou can st smoothe almost any seams and dents  nevermind how hard the metal  blacksmith   aye  sir  i think i can  all seams and dents but one   look ye here  then   cried ahab  passionately advancing  and leaningwith both hands on perth s shoulders   look ye here here can yesmoothe out a seam like this  blacksmith   sweeping one hand across hisribbed brow   if thou could st  blacksmith  glad enough would i lay myhead upon thy anvil  and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes answer 
can st thou smoothe this seam   oh 
that is the one  sir 
said i not all seams and dents but one   aye  blacksmith  it is the one  aye  man  it is unsmoothable  forthough thou only see st it here in my flesh  it has worked down intothe bone of my skull that is all wrinkles 
but  away with child splay  no more gaffs and pikes to day 
look ye here   jingling theleathern bag  as if it were full of gold coins 
 i  too  want a harpoonmade  one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part  perth something that will stick in a whale like his own fin bone 
there s thestuff   flinging the pouch upon the anvil 
 look ye  blacksmith  theseare the gathered nail stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses   horse shoe stubbs  sir 
why  captain ahab  thou hast here  then  thebest and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work   i know it  old man  these stubbs will weld together like glue from themelted bones of murderers 
forge me the harpoon 
and forge mefirst  twelve rods for its shank  then wind  and twist  and hammerthese twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow line 
quick i ll blow the fire  when at last the twelve rods were made  ahab tried them  one by one  byspiralling them  with his own hand  round a long  heavy iron bolt 
 aflaw   rejecting the last one 
 work that over again  perth  this done  perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one  whenahab stayed his hand  and said he would weld his own iron 
as  then with regular  gasping hems  he hammered on the anvil  perth passing tohim the glowing rods  one after the other  and the hard pressed forgeshooting up its intense straight flame  the parsee passed silently  andbowing over his head towards the fire  seemed invoking some curse orsome blessing on the toil 
but  as ahab looked up  he slid aside  what s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for   mutteredstubb  looking on from the forecastle 
 that parsee smells fire like afusee  and smells of it himself  like a hot musket s powder pan  at last the shank  in one complete rod  received its final heat  and asperth  to temper it  plunged it all hissing into the cask of water nearby  the scalding steam shot up into ahab s bent face  would st thou brand me  perth   wincing for a moment with the pain  have i been but forging my own branding iron  then   pray god  not that  yet i fear something  captain ahab 
is not thisharpoon for the white whale   for the white fiend 
but now for the barbs  thou must make themthyself  man 
here are my razors the best of steel  here  and make thebarbs sharp as the needle sleet of the icy sea  for a moment  the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he wouldfain not use them  take them  man  i have no need for them  for i now neither shave  sup nor pray till but here to work  fashioned at last into an arrowy shape  and welded by perth to theshank  the steel soon pointed the end of the iron  and as theblacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat  prior totempering them  he cried to ahab to place the water cask near  no  no no water for that  i want it of the true death temper 
tashtego  queequeg  daggoo 
what say ye  pagans 
will ye give meas much blood as will cover this barb   holding it high up 
a clusterof dark nods replied  yes 
three punctures were made in the heathenflesh  and the white whale s barbs were then tempered  ego non baptizo te in nomine patris  sed in nomine diaboli  deliriously howled ahab  as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured thebaptismal blood now  mustering the spare poles from below  and selecting one ofhickory  with the bark still investing it  ahab fitted the end to thesocket of the iron 
a coil of new tow line was then unwound  and somefathoms of it taken to the windlass  and stretched to a great tension pressing his foot upon it  till the rope hummed like a harp string then eagerly bending over it  and seeing no strandings  ahab exclaimed  good 
and now for the seizings  at one extremity the rope was unstranded  and the separate spread yarnswere all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon  the polewas then driven hard up into the socket  from the lower end the ropewas traced half way along the pole s length  and firmly secured so with intertwistings of twine 
this done  pole  iron  and rope like thethree fates remained inseparable  and ahab moodily stalked away withthe weapon  the sound of his ivory leg  and the sound of the hickorypole  both hollowly ringing along every plank 
but ere he entered hiscabin  light  unnatural  half bantering  yet most piteous sound washeard 
oh  pip

the gilder penetrating further and further into the heart of the japanese cruisingground  the pequod was soon all astir in the fishery 
often  in mild pleasant weather  for twelve  fifteen  eighteen  and twenty hours onthe stretch  they were engaged in the boats  steadily pulling  orsailing  or paddling after the whales  or for an interlude of sixty orseventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising  though with but smallsuccess for their pains at such times  under an abated sun  afloat all day upon smooth  slowheaving swells  seated in his boat  light as a birch canoe  and sosociably mixing with the soft waves themselves  that like hearth stonecats they purr against the gunwale  these are the times of dreamyquietude  when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of theocean s skin  one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it  andwould not willingly remember  that this velvet paw but conceals aremorseless fang these are the times  when in his whale boat the rover softly feels acertain filial  confident  land like feeling towards the sea  that heregards it as so much flowery earth  and the distant ship revealingonly the tops of her masts  seems struggling forward  not through highrolling waves  but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie  as whenthe western emigrants  horses only show their erected ears  while theirhidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure the long drawn virgin vales  the mild blue hill sides  as over thesethere steals the hush  the hum  you almost swear that play weariedchildren lie sleeping in these solitudes  in some glad may time  whenthe flowers of the woods are plucked 
and all this mixes with your mostmystic mood  so that fact and fancy  half way meeting  interpenetrate and form one seamless whole nor did such soothing scenes  however temporary  fail of at least astemporary an effect on ahab

the pequod meets the bachelor and jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing downbefore the wind  some few weeks after ahab s harpoon had been welded it was a nantucket ship  the bachelor  which had just wedged in herlast cask of oil  and bolted down her bursting hatches  and now  inglad holiday apparel  was joyously  though somewhat vain gloriously sailing round among the widely separated ships on the ground  previousto pointing her prow for home the three men at her mast head wore long streamers of narrow redbunting at their hats  from the stern  a whale boat was suspended bottom down  and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the longlower jaw of the last whale they had slain 
signals  ensigns  and jacksof all colours were flying from her rigging  on every side 
sidewayslashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm above which  in her top mast cross trees  you saw slender breakers ofthe same precious fluid  and nailed to her main truck was a brazenlamp as was afterwards learned  the bachelor had met with the mostsurprising success  all the more wonderful  for that while cruising inthe same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months withoutsecuring a single fish 
not only had barrels of beef and bread beengiven away to make room for the far more valuable sperm  but additionalsupplemental casks had been bartered for  from the ships she had met and these were stowed along the deck  and in the captain s andofficers  state rooms 
even the cabin table itself had been knockedinto kindling wood  and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of anoil butt  lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece 
in theforecastle  the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests and filled them  it was humorously added  that the cook had clapped ahead on his largest boiler  and filled it  that the steward had pluggedhis spare coffee pot and filled it  that the harpooneers had headed thesockets of their irons and filled them  that indeed everything wasfilled with sperm  except the captain s pantaloons pockets  and thosehe reserved to thrust his hands into  in self complacent testimony ofhis entire satisfaction as this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod  thebarbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle  and drawingstill nearer  a crowd of her men were seen standing round her hugetry pots  which  covered with the parchment like poke or stomach skinof the black fish  gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of theclenched hands of the crew 
on the quarter deck  the mates andharpooneers were dancing with the olive hued girls who had eloped withthem from the polynesian isles  while suspended in an ornamented boat firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast  three longisland negroes  with glittering fiddle bows of whale ivory  werepresiding over the hilarious jig 
meanwhile  others of the ship scompany were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try works  fromwhich the huge pots had been removed 
you would have almost thoughtthey were pulling down the cursed bastille  such wild cries theyraised  as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into thesea lord and master over all this scene  the captain stood erect on theship s elevated quarter deck  so that the whole rejoicing drama wasfull before him  and seemed merely contrived for his own individualdiversion and ahab  he too was standing on his quarter deck  shaggy and black with a stubborn gloom  and as the two ships crossed each other swakes one all jubilations for things passed  the other all forebodingsas to things to come their two captains in themselves impersonated thewhole striking contrast of the scene  come aboard  come aboard   cried the gay bachelor s commander  liftinga glass and a bottle in the air  hast seen the white whale   gritted ahab in reply  no  only heard of him  but don t believe in him at all   said theother good humoredly

i ll soon take that black from your brow

so go thy ways  and i will mine 
set all sail  and keep her to the wind  and thus  while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze  the otherstubbornly fought against it  and so the two vessels parted  the crewof the pequod looking with grave  lingering glances towards thereceding bachelor  but the bachelor s men never heeding their gaze forthe lively revelry they were in 
and as ahab  leaning over thetaffrail  eyed the homeward bound craft  he took from his pocket asmall vial of sand  and then looking from the ship to the vial  seemedthereby bringing two remote associations together  for that vial wasfilled with nantucket soundings chapter 116

so seemedit with the pequod 
for next day after encountering the gay bachelor whales were seen and four were slain  and one of them by ahab it was far down the afternoon  and when all the spearings of thecrimson fight were done  and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky sun and whale both stilly died together  then  such a sweetness andsuch plaintiveness  such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosyair  that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green conventvalleys of the manilla isles  the spanish land breeze  wantonly turnedsailor  had gone to sea  freighted with these vesper hymns soothed again  but only soothed to deeper gloom  ahab  who had sternedoff from the whale  sat intently watching his final wanings from thenow tranquil boat

the whale watch the four whales slain that evening had died wide apart  one  far towindward  one  less distant  to leeward  one ahead  one astern 
theselast three were brought alongside ere nightfall  but the windward onecould not be reached till morning  and the boat that had killed it layby its side all night  and that boat was ahab s the waif pole was thrust upright into the dead whale s spout hole  andthe lantern hanging from its top  cast a troubled flickering glare uponthe black  glossy back  and far out upon the midnight waves  whichgently chafed the whale s broad flank  like soft surf upon a beach ahab and all his boat s crew seemed asleep but the parsee  whocrouching in the bow  sat watching the sharks  that spectrally playedround the whale  and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails 
asound like the moaning in squadrons over asphaltites of unforgivenghosts of gomorrah  ran shuddering through the air started from his slumbers  ahab  face to face  saw the parsee  andhooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in aflooded world 
 i have dreamed it again   said he  of the hearses 
have i not said  old man  that neither hearse norcoffin can be thine   and who are hearsed that die on the sea   but i said  old man  that ere thou couldst die on this voyage  twohearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea  the first not made bymortal hands  and the visible wood of the last one must be grown inamerica   aye  aye 
a strange sight that  parsee  a hearse and its plumesfloating over the ocean with the waves for the pall bearers 
such asight we shall not soon see   believe it or not  thou canst not die till it be seen  old man   and what was that saying about thyself   though it come to the last  i shall still go before thee thy pilot   and when thou art so gone before if that ever befall then ere i canfollow  thou must still appear to me  to pilot me still  was it not so well  then  did i believe all ye say  oh my pilot 
i have here twopledges that i shall yet slay moby dick and survive it   take another pledge  old man   said the parsee  as his eyes lighted uplike fire flies in the gloom  hemp only can kill thee   the gallows  ye mean  i am immortal then  on land and on sea   criedahab  with a laugh of derision   immortal on land and on sea  both were silent again  as one man 
the grey dawn came on  and theslumbering crew arose from the boat s bottom  and ere noon the deadwhale was brought to the ship chapter 118 
the quadrant the season for the line at length drew near  and every day when ahab coming from his cabin  cast his eyes aloft  the vigilant helmsman wouldostentatiously handle his spokes  and the eager mariners quickly run tothe braces  and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixedon the nailed doubloon  impatient for the order to point the ship sprow for the equator 
in good time the order came 
it was hard uponhigh noon  and ahab  seated in the bows of his high hoisted boat  wasabout taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine hislatitude now  in that japanese sea  the days in summer are as freshets ofeffulgences 
that unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems the blazingfocus of the glassy ocean s immeasurable burning glass 
the sky lookslacquered  clouds there are none  the horizon floats  and thisnakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors ofgod s throne 
well that ahab s quadrant was furnished with colouredglasses  through which to take sight of that solar fire 
so  swinginghis seated form to the roll of the ship  and with hisastrological looking instrument placed to his eye  he remained in thatposture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sunshould gain its precise meridian 
meantime while his whole attentionwas absorbed  the parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship s deck and with face thrown up like ahab s  was eyeing the same sun with him only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs  and his wild face wassubdued to an earthly passionlessness 
at length the desiredobservation was taken  and with his pencil upon his ivory leg  ahabsoon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant 
thenfalling into a moment s revery  he again looked up towards the sun andmurmured to himself   thou sea mark 
thou high and mighty pilot 
thoutellest me truly where i am but canst thou cast the least hint wherei shall be 
or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me isthis moment living 
where is moby dick 
this instant thou must beeyeing him 
these eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even nowbeholding him  aye  and into the eye that is even now equally beholdingthe objects on the unknown  thither side of thee  thou sun  then gazing at his quadrant  and handling  one after the other  itsnumerous cabalistical contrivances  he pondered again  and muttered  foolish toy 
babies  plaything of haughty admirals  and commodores and captains  the world brags of thee  of thy cunning and might  butwhat after all canst thou do  but tell the poor  pitiful point  wherethou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet  and the hand thatholds thee  no 
not one jot more 
thou canst not tell where one drop ofwater or one grain of sand will be to morrow noon  and yet with thyimpotence thou insultest the sun 
curse thee  thou vain toy and cursed be all the things that cast man s eyes aloft to that heaven whose live vividness but scorches him  as these old eyes are even nowscorched with thy light  o sun 
level by nature to this earth s horizonare the glances of man s eyes  not shot from the crown of his head  asif god had meant him to gaze on his firmament 
curse thee  thouquadrant   dashing it to the deck   no longer will i guide my earthlyway by thee  the level ship s compass  and the level dead reckoning  bylog and by line  these shall conduct me  and show me my place on thesea 
aye   lighting from the boat to the deck   thus i trample on thee thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high  thus i split anddestroy thee  as the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live anddead feet  a sneering triumph that seemed meant for ahab  and afatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself these passed over themute  motionless parsee s face 
unobserved he rose and glided away while  awestruck by the aspect of their commander  the seamen clusteredtogether on the forecastle  till ahab  troubledly pacing the deck shouted out  to the braces 
up helm  square in  in an instant the yards swung round  and as the ship half wheeled uponher heel  her three firm seated graceful masts erectly poised upon herlong  ribbed hull  seemed as the three horatii pirouetting on onesufficient steed standing between the knight heads  starbuck watched the pequod stumultuous way  and ahab s also  as he went lurching along the deck  i have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow  fullof its tormented flaming life  and i have seen it wane at last  down down  to dumbest dust 
old man of oceans 
of all this fiery life ofthine  what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes   aye   cried stubb   but sea coal ashes mind ye that  mr starbuck sea coal  not your common charcoal 
well  well  i heard ahabmutter   here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands ofmine  swears that i must play them  and no others   and damn me  ahab but thou actest right  live in the game  and die in it  chapter 119 
the candles warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs  the tiger of bengalcrouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure 
skies the mosteffulgent but basket the deadliest thunders  gorgeous cuba knowstornadoes that never swept tame northern lands 
so  too  it is  that inthese resplendent japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst ofall storms  the typhoon 
it will sometimes burst from out thatcloudless sky  like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town towards evening of that day  the pequod was torn of her canvas  andbare poled was left to fight a typhoon which had struck her directlyahead 
when darkness came on  sky and sea roared and split with thethunder  and blazed with the lightning  that showed the disabled mastsfluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of thetempest had left for its after sport holding by a shroud  starbuck was standing on the quarter deck  atevery flash of the lightning glancing aloft  to see what additionaldisaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there  while stubband flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmerlashing of the boats 
but all their pains seemed naught 
though liftedto the very top of the cranes  the windward quarter boat  ahab s  didnot escape 
a great rolling sea  dashing high up against the reelingship s high teetering side  stove in the boat s bottom at the stern and left it again  all dripping through like a sieve  bad work  bad work 
mr  starbuck   said stubb  regarding the wreck  but the sea will have its way 
stubb  for one  can t fight it 
yousee  mr  starbuck  a wave has such a great long start before it leaps all round the world it runs  and then comes the spring 
but as for me all the start i have to meet it  is just across the deck here 
butnever mind  it s all in fun  so the old song says    sings  
jolly is the gale  and a joker is the whale  a  flourishin  his  tail   such a funny  sporty  gamy  jesty  joky  hoky poky lad  is the  ocean  oh 
the scud all a flyin   that s his flip only foamin   when he stirs in  the spicin    such a funny  sporty  gamy  jesty  joky  hoky poky lad   is the ocean  oh 
thunder splits the ships  but he only smacks his lips  a tastin  of  this flip   such a funny  sporty  gamy  jesty  joky  hoky poky lad   is the ocean  oh  avast stubb   cried starbuck   let the typhoon sing  and strike hisharp here in our rigging  but if thou art a brave man thou wilt holdthy peace   but i am not a brave man  never said i was a brave man  i am a coward and i sing to keep up my spirits 
and i tell you what it is  mr starbuck  there s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut mythroat 
and when that s done  ten to one i sing ye the doxology for awind up   madman 
look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own   what 
how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else  nevermind how foolish   here   cried starbuck  seizing stubb by the shoulder  and pointing hishand towards the weather bow   markest thou not that the gale comesfrom the eastward  the very course ahab is to run for moby dick 
thevery course he swung to this day noon 
now mark his boat there  whereis that stove 
in the stern sheets  man  where he is wont to stand hisstand point is stove  man 
now jump overboard  and sing away  if thoumust  i don t half understand ye  what s in the wind   yes  yes  round the cape of good hope is the shortest way tonantucket   soliloquized starbuck suddenly  heedless of stubb squestion 
 the gale that now hammers at us to stave us  we can turn itinto a fair wind that will drive us towards home 
yonder  to windward all is blackness of doom  but to leeward  homeward i see it lightens upthere  but not with the lightning  at that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness  followingthe flashes  a voice was heard at his side  and almost at the sameinstant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead  who s there   old thunder   said ahab  groping his way along the bulwarks to hispivot hole  but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowedlances of fire now  as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry offthe perilous fluid into the soil  so the kindred rod which at sea someships carry to each mast  is intended to conduct it into the water 
butas this conductor must descend to considerable depth  that its end mayavoid all contact with the hull  and as moreover  if kept constantlytowing there  it would be liable to many mishaps  besides interferingnot a little with some of the rigging  and more or less impeding thevessel s way in the water  because of all this  the lower parts of aship s lightning rods are not always overboard  but are generally madein long slender links  so as to be the more readily hauled up into thechains outside  or thrown down into the sea  as occasion may require  the rods 
the rods   cried starbuck to the crew  suddenly admonishedto vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been dartingflambeaux  to light ahab to his post 
 are they overboard 
drop themover  fore and aft 
quick   avast   cried ahab   let s have fair play here  though we be theweaker side 
yet i ll contribute to raise rods on the himmalehs andandes  that all the world may be secured  but out on privileges 
letthem be  sir   look aloft   cried starbuck 
 the corpusants 
the corpusants  all the yard arms were tipped with a pallid fire  and touched at eachtri pointed lightning rod end with three tapering white flames  each ofthe three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air  likethree gigantic wax tapers before an altar  blast the boat 
let it go   cried stubb at this instant  as a swashingsea heaved up under his own little craft  so that its gunwale violentlyjammed his hand  as he was passing a lashing 
 blast it   but slippingbackward on the deck  his uplifted eyes caught the flames  andimmediately shifting his tone he cried  the corpusants have mercy on usall  to sailors  oaths are household words  they will swear in the trance ofthe calm  and in the teeth of the tempest  they will imprecate cursesfrom the topsail yard arms  when most they teeter over to a seethingsea  but in all my voyagings  seldom have i heard a common oath whengod s burning finger has been laid on the ship  when his  mene  mene tekel upharsin  has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage while this pallidness was burning aloft  few words were heard from theenchanted crew  who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle  alltheir eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence  like a far awayconstellation of stars 
relieved against the ghostly light  thegigantic jet negro  daggoo  loomed up to thrice his real stature  andseemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come 
the partedmouth of tashtego revealed his shark white teeth  which strangelygleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants  while lit up bythe preternatural light  queequeg s tattooing burned like satanic blueflames on his body the tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft  and once morethe pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall 
a momentor two passed  when starbuck  going forward  pushed against some one it was stubb 
 what thinkest thou now  man  i heard thy cry  it was notthe same in the song   no  no  it wasn t  i said the corpusants have mercy on us all  and ihope they will  still 
but do they only have mercy on long faces  havethey no bowels for a laugh 
and look ye  mr  starbuck but it s too darkto look 
hear me  then  i take that mast head flame we saw for a signof good luck  for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to bechock a  block with sperm oil  d ye see  and so  all that sperm willwork up into the masts  like sap in a tree 
yes  our three masts willyet be as three spermaceti candles that s the good promise we saw  at that moment starbuck caught sight of stubb s face slowly beginningto glimmer into sight 
glancing upwards  he cried   see 
see   and oncemore the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubledsupernaturalness in their pallor  the corpusants have mercy on us all   cried stubb  again at the base of the mainmast  full beneath the doubloon and the flame the parsee was kneeling in ahab s front  but with his head bowed awayfrom him  while near by  from the arched and overhanging rigging  wherethey had just been engaged securing a spar  a number of the seamen arrested by the glare  now cohered together  and hung pendulous  like aknot of numbed wasps from a drooping  orchard twig 
in variousenchanted attitudes  like the standing  or stepping  or runningskeletons in herculaneum  others remained rooted to the deck  but alltheir eyes upcast  aye  aye  men   cried ahab 
 look up at it  mark it well  the whiteflame but lights the way to the white whale 
hand me those mainmastlinks there  i would fain feel this pulse  and let mine beat againstit  blood against fire 
so  then turning the last link held fast in his left hand  he put his footupon the parsee  and with fixed upward eye  and high flung right arm he stood erect before the lofty tri pointed trinity of flames  oh 
thou clear spirit of clear fire  whom on these seas i as persianonce did worship  till in the sacramental act so burned by thee  thatto this hour i bear the scar  i now know thee  thou clear spirit  and inow know that thy right worship is defiance 
to neither love norreverence wilt thou be kind  and e en for hate thou canst but kill  andall are killed 
no fearless fool now fronts thee 
i own thy speechless placeless power  but to the last gasp of my earthquake life willdispute its unconditional  unintegral mastery in me 
in the midst ofthe personified impersonal  a personality stands here 
though but apoint at best  whencesoe er i came  wheresoe er i go  yet while iearthly live  the queenly personality lives in me  and feels her royalrights 
but war is pain  and hate is woe 
come in thy lowest form oflove  and i will kneel and kiss thee  but at thy highest  come as meresupernal power  and though thou launchest navies of full freightedworlds  there s that in here that still remains indifferent 
oh  thouclear spirit  of thy fire thou madest me  and like a true child offire  i breathe it back to thee   sudden  repeated flashes of lightning  the nine flames leaplengthwise to thrice their previous height  ahab  with the rest  closeshis eyes  his right hand pressed hard upon them   i own thy speechless  placeless power  said i not so 
nor was it wrungfrom me  nor do i now drop these links 
thou canst blind  but i canthen grope 
thou canst consume  but i can then be ashes 
take thehomage of these poor eyes  and shutter hands 
i would not take it 
thelightning flashes through my skull  mine eye balls ache and ache  mywhole beaten brain seems as beheaded  and rolling on some stunningground 
oh  oh 
yet blindfold  yet will i talk to thee 
light thoughthou be  thou leapest out of darkness  but i am darkness leaping out oflight  leaping out of thee 
the javelins cease  open eyes  see  or not there burn the flames 
oh  thou magnanimous 
now i do glory in mygenealogy 
but thou art but my fiery father  my sweet mother  i knownot 
oh  cruel 
what hast thou done with her 
there lies my puzzle  butthine is greater 
thou knowest not how came ye  hence callest thyselfunbegotten  certainly knowest not thy beginning  hence callest thyselfunbegun 
i know that of me  which thou knowest not of thyself  oh  thouomnipotent 
there is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee  thou clearspirit  to whom all thy eternity is but time  all thy creativenessmechanical 
through thee  thy flaming self  my scorched eyes do dimlysee it 
oh  thou foundling fire  thou hermit immemorial  thou too hastthy incommunicable riddle  thy unparticipated grief 
here again withhaughty agony  i read my sire 
leap up  and lick the sky 
i leapwith thee  i burn with thee  would fain be welded with thee  defyinglyi worship thee   the boat 
the boat   cried starbuck   look at thy boat  old man  ahab s harpoon  the one forged at perth s fire  remained firmly lashedin its conspicuous crotch  so that it projected beyond his whale boat sbow  but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leathersheath to drop off  and from the keen steel barb there now came alevelled flame of pale  forked fire 
as the silent harpoon burned therelike a serpent s tongue  starbuck grasped ahab by the arm  god  god isagainst thee  old man  forbear 
 tis an ill voyage 
ill begun  illcontinued  let me square the yards  while we may  old man  and make afair wind of it homewards  to go on a better voyage than this  overhearing starbuck  the panic stricken crew instantly ran to thebraces though not a sail was left aloft 
for the moment all the aghastmate s thoughts seemed theirs  they raised a half mutinous cry 
butdashing the rattling lightning links to the deck  and snatching theburning harpoon  ahab waved it like a torch among them  swearing totransfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope s end petrified by his aspect  and still more shrinking from the fiery dartthat he held  the men fell back in dismay  and ahab again spoke   all your oaths to hunt the white whale are as binding as mine  andheart  soul  and body  lungs and life  old ahab is bound 
and that yemay know to what tune this heart beats  look ye here  thus i blow outthe last fear   and with one blast of his breath he extinguished theflame as in the hurricane that sweeps the plain  men fly the neighborhood ofsome lone  gigantic elm  whose very height and strength but render itso much the more unsafe  because so much the more a mark forthunderbolts  so at those last words of ahab s many of the mariners didrun from him in a terror of dismay chapter 120 
the deck towards the end of the first night watch ahab standing by the helm 
starbuck approaching him  we must send down the main top sail yard  sir 
the band is workingloose and the lee lift is half stranded 
shall i strike it  sir   strike nothing  lash it 
if i had sky sail poles  i d sway them upnow   sir  in god s name  sir   well   the anchors are working  sir 
shall i get them inboard   strike nothing  and stir nothing  but lash everything 
the wind rises but it has not got up to my table lands yet 
quick  and see to it  bymasts and keels 
he takes me for the hunch backed skipper of somecoasting smack 
send down my main top sail yard 
ho  gluepots 
loftiesttrucks were made for wildest winds  and this brain truck of mine nowsails amid the cloud scud 
shall i strike that 
oh  none but cowardssend down their brain trucks in tempest time 
what a hooroosh aloftthere 
i would e en take it for sublime  did i not know that the colicis a noisy malady 
oh  take medicine  take medicine  chapter 121 
midnight  the forecastle bulwarks stubb and flask mounted on them  and passing additional lashings overthe anchors there hanging  no  stubb  you may pound that knot there as much as you please  butyou will never pound into me what you were just now saying 
and howlong ago is it since you said the very contrary 
didn t you once saythat whatever ship ahab sails in  that ship should pay something extraon its insurance policy  just as though it were loaded with powderbarrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward 
stop  now  didn t you sayso   well  suppose i did 
what then 
i ve part changed my flesh since thattime  why not my mind 
besides  supposing we are loaded with powderbarrels aft and lucifers forward  how the devil could the lucifers getafire in this drenching spray here 
why  my little man  you have prettyred hair  but you couldn t get afire now 
shake yourself  you reaquarius  or the water bearer  flask  might fill pitchers at your coatcollar 
don t you see  then  that for these extra risks the marineinsurance companies have extra guarantees 
here are hydrants  flask but hark  again  and i ll answer ye the other thing 
first take yourleg off from the crown of the anchor here  though  so i can pass therope  now listen 
what s the mighty difference between holding a mast slightning rod in the storm  and standing close by a mast that hasn tgot any lightning rod at all in a storm 
don t you see  youtimber head  that no harm can come to the holder of the rod  unless themast is first struck 
what are you talking about  then 
not one ship ina hundred carries rods  and ahab  aye  man  and all of us  were in nomore danger then  in my poor opinion  than all the crews in tenthousand ships now sailing the seas 
why  you king post  you  i supposeyou would have every man in the world go about with a smalllightning rod running up the corner of his hat  like a militiaofficer s skewered feather  and trailing behind like his sash 
whydon t ye be sensible  flask 
it s easy to be sensible  why don t ye then 
any man with half an eye can be sensible   i don t know that  stubb 
you sometimes find it rather hard   yes  when a fellow s soaked through  it s hard to be sensible  that sa fact 
and i am about drenched with this spray 
never mind  catch theturn there  and pass it 
seems to me we are lashing down these anchorsnow as if they were never going to be used again 
tying these twoanchors here  flask  seems like tying a man s hands behind him 
andwhat big generous hands they are  to be sure 
these are your ironfists  hey 
what a hold they have  too 
i wonder  flask  whether theworld is anchored anywhere  if she is  she swings with an uncommon longcable  though 
there  hammer that knot down  and we ve done 
so  nextto touching land  lighting on deck is the most satisfactory 
i say just wring out my jacket skirts  will ye 
thank ye 
they laugh atlong togs so  flask  but seems to me  a long tailed coat ought alwaysto be worn in all storms afloat 
the tails tapering down that way serve to carry off the water  d ye see 
same with cocked hats  thecocks form gable end eave troughs  flask 
no more monkey jackets andtarpaulins for me  i must mount a swallow tail  and drive down abeaver  so 
there goes my tarpaulin overboard  lord lord  that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly this is a nasty night  lad  chapter 122 
midnight aloft  thunder and lightning the main top sail yard  tashtego passing new lashings around it  um  um  um 
stop that thunder 
plenty too much thunder up here 
what sthe use of thunder 
um  um  um 
we don t want thunder  we want rum give us a glass of rum 
um  um  um  chapter 123 
the musket during the most violent shocks of the typhoon  the man at the pequod sjaw bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck byits spasmodic motions  even though preventer tackles had been attachedto it for they were slack because some play to the tiller wasindispensable in a severe gale like this  while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecockto the blast  it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in thecompasses  at intervals  go round and round 
it was thus with thepequod s  at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to noticethe whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards  it is asight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwontedemotion some hours after midnight  the typhoon abated so much  that through thestrenuous exertions of starbuck and stubb one engaged forward and theother aft the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main top sailswere cut adrift from the spars  and went eddying away to leeward  likethe feathers of an albatross  which sometimes are cast to the windswhen that storm tossed bird is on the wing the three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed  and astorm trysail was set further aft  so that the ship soon went throughthe water with some precision again  and the course for the present east south east which he was to steer  if practicable  was once moregiven to the helmsman 
for during the violence of the gale  he had onlysteered according to its vicissitudes 
but as he was now bringing theship as near her course as possible  watching the compass meanwhile lo 
a good sign 
the wind seemed coming round astern  aye  the foulbreeze became fair instantly the yards were squared  to the lively song of  ho 
the fairwind 
oh ye ho  cheerly men   the crew singing for joy  that sopromising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portentspreceding it in compliance with the standing order of his commander to reportimmediately  and at any one of the twenty four hours  any decidedchange in the affairs of the deck  starbuck had no sooner trimmed theyards to the breeze however reluctantly and gloomily  than hemechanically went below to apprise captain ahab of the circumstance ere knocking at his state room  he involuntarily paused before it amoment 
the cabin lamp taking long swings this way and that was burningfitfully  and casting fitful shadows upon the old man s bolted door  athin one  with fixed blinds inserted  in place of upper panels 
theisolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silenceto reign there  though it was hooped round by all the roar of theelements 
the loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed  asthey stood upright against the forward bulkhead 
starbuck was anhonest  upright man  but out of starbuck s heart  at that instant whenhe saw the muskets  there strangely evolved an evil thought  but soblent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant hehardly knew it for itself  he would have shot me once   he murmured   yes  there s the verymusket that he pointed at me  that one with the studded stock  let metouch it lift it 
strange  that i  who have handled so many deadlylances  strange  that i should shake so now 
i must see 
aye aye  and powder in the pan  that s not good 
best spill it  wait 
i llcure myself of this 
i ll hold the musket boldly while i think  i cometo report a fair wind to him 
but how fair 
fair for death anddoom  that s fair for moby dick 
it s a fair wind that s only fairfor that accursed fish  the very tube he pointed at me  the very one this one i hold it here  he would have killed me with the very thingi handle now  aye and he would fain kill all his crew 
does he not sayhe will not strike his spars to any gale 
has he not dashed hisheavenly quadrant 
and in these same perilous seas  gropes he not hisway by mere dead reckoning of the error abounding log 
and in this verytyphoon  did he not swear that he would have no lightning rods 
butshall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship scompany down to doom with him  yes  it would make him the wilfulmurderer of thirty men and more  if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harm  my soul swears this ship will  if ahab havehis way 
if  then  he were this instant put aside  that crime would notbe his 
is he muttering in his sleep 
yes  just there  in there he s sleeping 
aye  but still alive  and soon awake again 
ican t withstand thee  then  old man 
not reasoning  not remonstrance not entreaty wilt thou hearken to  all this thou scornest 
flatobedience to thy own flat commands  this is all thou breathest 
aye and say st the men have vow d thy vow  say st all of us are ahabs great god forbid  but is there no other way 
no lawful way  make him aprisoner to be taken home 
hope to wrest this old man s livingpower from his own living hands 
only a fool would try it 
say he werepinioned even  knotted all over with ropes and hawsers  chained down toring bolts on this cabin floor  he would be more hideous than a cagedtiger  then 
i could not endure the sight  could not possibly fly hishowlings  all comfort  sleep itself  inestimable reason would leave meon the long intolerable voyage 
what  then  remains 
the land ishundreds of leagues away  and locked japan the nearest 
i stand alonehere upon an open sea  with two oceans and a whole continent between meand law  aye  aye   tis so  is heaven a murderer when its lightningstrikes a would be murderer in his bed  tindering sheets and skintogether  and would i be a murderer  then  if  and slowly  stealthily and half sideways looking  he placed the loaded musket s end againstthe door  on this level  ahab s hammock swings within  his head this way 
atouch  and starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again  ohmary 
boy  but if i wake thee not to death  old man who can tell to what unsounded deeps starbuck s body this day week maysink  with all the crew 
great god  where art thou

oh moby dick  i clutch thy heart at last  such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man stormented sleep  as if starbuck s voice had caused the long dumb dreamto speak the yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard s arm against the panel starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel  but turning from the door  heplaced the death tube in its rack  and left the place  he s too sound asleep  mr  stubb  go thou down  and wake him  and tellhim

the needle next morning the not yet subsided sea rolled in long slow billows ofmighty bulk  and striving in the pequod s gurgling track  pushed her onlike giants  palms outspread 
the strong  unstaggering breeze aboundedso  that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails  the whole worldboomed before the wind 
muffled in the full morning light  theinvisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks 
emblazonings  as of crownedbabylonian kings and queens  reigned over everything 
the sea was as acrucible of molten gold  that bubblingly leaps with light and heat long maintaining an enchanted silence  ahab stood apart  and every timethe tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit  he turned toeye the bright sun s rays produced ahead  and when she profoundlysettled by the stern  he turned behind  and saw the sun s rearwardplace  and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviatingwake  ha  ha  my ship 
thou mightest well be taken now for the sea chariotof the sun 
ho  ho 
all ye nations before my prow  i bring the sun toye 
yoke on the further billows  hallo 
a tandem  i drive the sea  but suddenly reined back by some counter thought  he hurried towardsthe helm  huskily demanding how the ship was heading  east sou east  sir   said the frightened steersman  thou liest   smiting him with his clenched fist 
 heading east at thishour in the morning  and the sun astern  upon this every soul was confounded  for the phenomenon just thenobserved by ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else  but its veryblinding palpableness must have been the cause thrusting his head half way into the binnacle  ahab caught one glimpseof the compasses  his uplifted arm slowly fell  for a moment he almostseemed to stagger 
standing behind him starbuck looked  and lo 
the twocompasses pointed east  and the pequod was as infallibly going west but ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew  theold man with a rigid laugh exclaimed   i have it 
it has happenedbefore 
mr  starbuck  last night s thunder turned our compasses that sall 
thou hast before now heard of such a thing  i take it   aye  but never before has it happened to me  sir   said the pale mate gloomily here  it must needs be said  that accidents like this have in more thanone case occurred to ships in violent storms 
the magnetic energy  asdeveloped in the mariner s needle  is  as all know  essentially onewith the electricity beheld in heaven  hence it is not to be muchmarvelled at  that such things should be 
instances where the lightninghas actually struck the vessel  so as to smite down some of the sparsand rigging  the effect upon the needle has at times been still morefatal  all its loadstone virtue being annihilated  so that the beforemagnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife s knitting needle but in either case  the needle never again  of itself  recovers theoriginal virtue thus marred or lost  and if the binnacle compasses beaffected  the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson deliberately standing before the binnacle  and eyeing the transpointedcompasses  the old man  with the sharp of his extended hand  now tookthe precise bearing of the sun  and satisfied that the needles wereexactly inverted  shouted out his orders for the ship s course to bechanged accordingly 
the yards were hard up  and once more the pequodthrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind  for the supposed fairone had only been juggling her meanwhile  whatever were his own secret thoughts  starbuck saidnothing  but quietly he issued all requisite orders  while stubb andflask who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing hisfeelings likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced 
as for the men  though someof them lowly rumbled  their fear of ahab was greater than their fearof fate 
but as ever before  the pagan harpooneers remained almostwholly unimpressed  or if impressed  it was only with a certainmagnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible ahab s for a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries 
butchancing to slip with his ivory heel  he saw the crushed coppersight tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck  thou poor  proud heaven gazer and sun s pilot 
yesterday i wreckedthee  and to day the compasses would fain have wrecked me 
so  so 
butahab is lord over the level loadstone yet 
mr  starbuck a lance withouta pole  a top maul  and the smallest of the sail maker s needles quick  accessory  perhaps  to the impulse dictating the thing he was now aboutto do  were certain prudential motives  whose object might have been torevive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill  in amatter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses 
besides  the oldman well knew that to steer by transpointed needles  though clumsilypracticable  was not a thing to be passed over by superstitioussailors  without some shudderings and evil portents  men   said he  steadily turning upon the crew  as the mate handed himthe things he had demanded   my men  the thunder turned old ahab sneedles  but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own that will point as true as any  abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors  asthis was said  and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magicmight follow 
but starbuck looked away with a blow from the top maul ahab knocked off the steel head of thelance  and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining  badehim hold it upright  without its touching the deck 
then  with themaul  after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod  heplaced the blunted needle endwise on the top of it  and less stronglyhammered that  several times  the mate still holding the rod as before then going through some small strange motions with it whetherindispensable to the magnetizing of the steel  or merely intended toaugment the awe of the crew  is uncertain he called for linen thread and moving to the binnacle  slipped out the two reversed needles there and horizontally suspended the sail needle by its middle  over one ofthe compass cards 
at first  the steel went round and round  quiveringand vibrating at either end  but at last it settled to its place  whenahab  who had been intently watching for this result  stepped franklyback from the binnacle  and pointing his stretched arm towards it exclaimed   look ye  for yourselves  if ahab be not lord of the levelloadstone 
the sun is east  and that compass swears it  one after another they peered in  for nothing but their own eyes couldpersuade such ignorance as theirs  and one after another they slunkaway in his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph  you then saw ahab in all hisfatal pride chapter 125 
the log and line while now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this voyage  the logand line had but very seldom been in use 
owing to a confident relianceupon other means of determining the vessel s place  some merchantmen and many whalemen  especially when cruising  wholly neglect to heavethe log  though at the same time  and frequently more for form s sakethan anything else  regularly putting down upon the customary slate thecourse steered by the ship  as well as the presumed average rate ofprogression every hour 
it had been thus with the pequod 
the woodenreel and angular log attached hung  long untouched  just beneath therailing of the after bulwarks 
rains and spray had damped it  sun andwind had warped it  all the elements had combined to rot a thing thathung so idly 
but heedless of all this  his mood seized ahab  as hehappened to glance upon the reel  not many hours after the magnetscene  and he remembered how his quadrant was no more  and recalled hisfrantic oath about the level log and line 
the ship was sailingplungingly  astern the billows rolled in riots  forward  there 
heave the log  two seamen came 
the golden hued tahitian and the grizzly manxman  take the reel  one of ye  i ll heave  they went towards the extreme stern  on the ship s lee side  where thedeck  with the oblique energy of the wind  was now almost dipping intothe creamy  sidelong rushing sea the manxman took the reel  and holding it high up  by the projectinghandle ends of the spindle  round which the spool of line revolved  sostood with the angular log hanging downwards  till ahab advanced tohim ahab stood before him  and was lightly unwinding some thirty or fortyturns to form a preliminary hand coil to toss overboard  when the oldmanxman  who was intently eyeing both him and the line  made bold tospeak  sir  i mistrust it  this line looks far gone  long heat and wet havespoiled it    twill hold  old gentleman 
long heat and wet  have they spoiled thee thou seem st to hold 
or  truer perhaps  life holds thee  not thou it   i hold the spool  sir 
but just as my captain says 
with these greyhairs of mine  tis not worth while disputing   specially with asuperior  who ll ne er confess   what s that 
there now s a patched professor in queen nature sgranite founded college  but methinks he s too subservient 
where wertthou born   in the little rocky isle of man  sir   excellent 
thou st hit the world by that   i know not  sir  but i was born there   in the isle of man  hey 
well  the other way  it s good 
here s a manfrom man  a man born in once independent man  and now unmanned of man which is sucked in by what 
up with the reel 
the dead  blind wallbutts all inquiring heads at last 
up with it 
so  the log was heaved 
the loose coils rapidly straightened out in a longdragging line astern  and then  instantly  the reel began to whirl 
inturn  jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows  the towingresistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely  hold hard  snap 
the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon  thetugging log was gone  i crush the quadrant  the thunder turns the needles  and now the madsea parts the log line 
but ahab can mend all 
haul in here  tahitian reel up  manxman 
and look ye  let the carpenter make another log  andmend thou the line 
see to it   there he goes now  to him nothing s happened  but to me  the skewerseems loosening out of the middle of the world 
haul in  haul in tahitian 
these lines run whole  and whirling out  come in broken  anddragging slow

captain ahab 
here s pip  trying to get on board again   peace  thou crazy loon   cried the manxman  seizing him by the arm  away from the quarter deck   the greater idiot ever scolds the lesser   muttered ahab  advancing  hands off from that holiness 
where sayest thou pip was  boy  astern there  sir  astern 
lo   and who art thou  boy 
i see not my reflection in the vacant pupils ofthy eyes

 ah  now  had poor pip but felt so kind a thingas this  perhaps he had ne er been lost

oh  sir  let old perthnow come and rivet these two hands together  the black one with thewhite  for i will not let this go   oh  boy  nor will i thee  unless i should thereby drag thee to worsehorrors than are here

i think we had best have anew line altogether 
i ll see mr  stubb about it  chapter 126 
the life buoy steering now south eastward by ahab s levelled steel  and her progresssolely determined by ahab s level log and line  the pequod held on herpath towards the equator 
making so long a passage through suchunfrequented waters  descrying no ships  and ere long  sidewaysimpelled by unvarying trade winds  over waves monotonously mild  allthese seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous anddesperate scene at last  when the ship drew near to the outskirts  as it were  of theequatorial fishing ground  and in the deep darkness that goes beforethe dawn  was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets  the watch thenheaded by flask was startled by a cry so plaintively wild andunearthly like half articulated wailings of the ghosts of all herod smurdered innocents that one and all  they started from their reveries and for the space of some moments stood  or sat  or leaned alltransfixedly listening  like the carved roman slave  while that wildcry remained within hearing 
the christian or civilized part of thecrew said it was mermaids  and shuddered  but the pagan harpooneersremained unappalled 
yet the grey manxman the oldest mariner ofall declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard  were thevoices of newly drowned men in the sea below in his hammock  ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn  when hecame to the deck  it was then recounted to him by flask  notunaccompanied with hinted dark meanings 
he hollowly laughed  and thusexplained the wonder those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of greatnumbers of seals  and some young seals that had lost their dams  orsome dams that had lost their cubs  must have risen nigh the ship andkept company with her  crying and sobbing with their human sort ofwail 
but this only the more affected some of them  because mostmariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals  arising notonly from their peculiar tones when in distress  but also from thehuman look of their round heads and semi intelligent faces  seenpeeringly uprising from the water alongside 
in the sea  under certaincircumstances  seals have more than once been mistaken for men but the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausibleconfirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning 
atsun rise this man went from his hammock to his mast head at the fore and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep  forsailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state   whether it was thuswith the man  there is now no telling  but  be that as it may  he hadnot been long at his perch  when a cry was heard a cry and arushing and looking up  they saw a falling phantom in the air  andlooking down  a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of thesea the life buoy a long slender cask was dropped from the stern  where italways hung obedient to a cunning spring  but no hand rose to seize it and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken  so that itslowly filled  and that parched wood also filled at its every pore  andthe studded iron bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom  as if toyield him his pillow  though in sooth but a hard one and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look outfor the white whale  on the white whale s own peculiar ground  that manwas swallowed up in the deep 
but few  perhaps  thought of that at thetime 
indeed  in some sort  they were not grieved at this event  atleast as a portent  for they regarded it  not as a foreshadowing ofevil in the future  but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged they declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks theyhad heard the night before 
but again the old manxman said nay the lost life buoy was now to be replaced  starbuck was directed to seeto it  but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found  and as inthe feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of thevoyage  all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directlyconnected with its final end  whatever that might prove to be therefore  they were going to leave the ship s stern unprovided with abuoy  when by certain strange signs and inuendoes queequeg hinted ahint concerning his coffin  a life buoy of a coffin   cried starbuck  starting  rather queer  that  i should say   said stubb  it will make a good enough one   said flask   the carpenter here canarrange it easily   bring it up  there s nothing else for it   said starbuck  after amelancholy pause 
 rig it  carpenter  do not look at me so the coffin i mean 
dost thou hear me 
rig it   and shall i nail down the lid  sir   moving his hand as with a hammer  aye   and shall i caulk the seams  sir   moving his hand as with acaulking iron  aye   and shall i then pay over the same with pitch  sir   moving his handas with a pitch pot  away 
what possesses thee to this 
make a life buoy of the coffin  andno more  mr 
stubb  mr  flask  come forward with me   he goes off in a huff 
the whole he can endure  at the parts hebaulks 
now i don t like this 
i make a leg for captain ahab  and hewears it like a gentleman  but i make a bandbox for queequeg  and hewon t put his head into it 
are all my pains to go for nothing withthat coffin 
and now i m ordered to make a life buoy of it 
it s liketurning an old coat  going to bring the flesh on the other side now 
idon t like this cobbling sort of business i don t like it at all  it sundignified  it s not my place 
let tinkers  brats do tinkerings  weare their betters 
i like to take in hand none but clean  virgin fair and square mathematical jobs  something that regularly begins atthe beginning  and is at the middle when midway  and comes to an end atthe conclusion  not a cobbler s job  that s at an end in the middle and at the beginning at the end 
it s the old woman s tricks to begiving cobbling jobs 
what an affection all old women have fortinkers 
i know an old woman of sixty five who ran away with abald headed young tinker once 
and that s the reason i never would workfor lonely widow old women ashore  when i kept my job shop in thevineyard  they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to runoff with me 
but heigh ho 
there are no caps at sea but snow caps 
letme see 
nail down the lid  caulk the seams  pay over the same withpitch  batten them down tight  and hang it with the snap spring overthe ship s stern 
were ever such things done before with a coffin 
somesuperstitious old carpenters  now  would be tied up in the rigging  erethey would do the job 
but i m made of knotty aroostook hemlock  idon t budge 
cruppered with a coffin 
sailing about with a grave yardtray 
but never mind 
we workers in woods make bridal bedsteads andcard tables  as well as coffins and hearses 
we work by the month  orby the job  or by the profit  not for us to ask the why and whereforeof our work  unless it be too confounded cobbling  and then we stash itif we can 
i ll do the job  now  tenderly 
i ll have me let ssee how many in the ship s company  all told 
but i ve forgotten 
anyway  i ll have me thirty separate  turk s headed life lines  each threefeet long hanging all round to the coffin

but art thou not also the undertaker   aye  sir  i patched up this thing here as a coffin for queequeg  butthey ve set me now to turning it into something else   then tell me  art thou not an arrant  all grasping  intermeddling monopolising  heathenish old scamp  to be one day making legs  and thenext day coffins to clap them in  and yet again life buoys out of thosesame coffins 
thou art as unprincipled as the gods  and as much of ajack of all trades   but i do not mean anything  sir 
i do as i do   the gods again 
hark ye  dost thou not ever sing working about acoffin 
the titans  they say  hummed snatches when chipping out thecraters for volcanoes  and the grave digger in the play sings  spade inhand 
dost thou never   sing  sir 
do i sing 
oh  i m indifferent enough  sir  for that  butthe reason why the grave digger made music must have been because therewas none in his spade  sir 
but the caulking mallet is full of it 
harkto it   aye  and that s because the lid there s a sounding board  and what inall things makes the sounding board is this there s naught beneath 
andyet  a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same  carpenter hast thou ever helped carry a bier  and heard the coffin knock againstthe churchyard gate  going in  faith  sir  i ve    faith 
what s that   why  faith  sir  it s only a sort of exclamation like that s all sir   um  um  go on   i was about to say  sir  that    art thou a silk worm 
dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself look at thy bosom

the pequod meets the rachel next day  a large ship  the rachel  was descried  bearing directly downupon the pequod  all her spars thickly clustering with men 
at the timethe pequod was making good speed through the water  but as thebroad winged windward stranger shot nigh to her  the boastful sails allfell together as blank bladders that are burst  and all life fled fromthe smitten hull  bad news  she brings bad news   muttered the old manxman 
but ere hercommander  who  with trumpet to mouth  stood up in his boat  ere hecould hopefully hail  ahab s voice was heard  hast seen the white whale   aye  yesterday 
have ye seen a whale boat adrift  throttling his joy  ahab negatively answered this unexpected question and would then have fain boarded the stranger  when the strangercaptain himself  having stopped his vessel s way  was seen descendingher side 
a few keen pulls  and his boat hook soon clinched thepequod s main chains  and he sprang to the deck 
immediately he wasrecognised by ahab for a nantucketer he knew 
but no formal salutationwas exchanged  where was he  not killed  not killed   cried ahab  closely advancing  how was it  it seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous while three of the stranger s boats were engaged with a shoal ofwhales  which had led them some four or five miles from the ship  andwhile they were yet in swift chase to windward  the white hump and headof moby dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water  not very far toleeward  whereupon  the fourth rigged boat a reserved one had beeninstantly lowered in chase 
after a keen sail before the wind  thisfourth boat the swiftest keeled of all seemed to have succeeded infastening at least  as well as the man at the mast head could tellanything about it 
in the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water  and after that nothingmore  whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must haveindefinitely run away with his pursuers  as often happens 
there wassome apprehension  but no positive alarm  as yet 
the recall signalswere placed in the rigging  darkness came on  and forced to pick up herthree far to windward boats ere going in quest of the fourth one in theprecisely opposite direction the ship had not only been necessitated toleave that boat to its fate till near midnight  but  for the time  toincrease her distance from it 
but the rest of her crew being at lastsafe aboard  she crowded all sail stunsail on stunsail after themissing boat  kindling a fire in her try pots for a beacon  and everyother man aloft on the look out 
but though when she had thus sailed asufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones whenlast seen  though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull allaround her  and not finding anything  had again dashed on  againpaused  and lowered her boats  and though she had thus continued doingtill daylight  yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had beenseen the story told  the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal hisobject in boarding the pequod 
he desired that ship to unite with hisown in the search  by sailing over the sea some four or five milesapart  on parallel lines  and so sweeping a double horizon  as it were  i will wager something now   whispered stubb to flask   that some onein that missing boat wore off that captain s best coat  mayhap  hiswatch he s so cursed anxious to get it back 
who ever heard of twopious whale ships cruising after one missing whale boat in the heightof the whaling season 
see  flask  only see how pale he looks pale inthe very buttons of his eyes look it wasn t the coat it must have beenthe   my boy  my own boy is among them 
for god s sake i beg  iconjure  here exclaimed the stranger captain to ahab  who thus far hadbut icily received his petition 
 for eight and forty hours let mecharter your ship i will gladly pay for it  and roundly pay for it ifthere be no other way for eight and forty hours only only that youmust  oh  you must  and you shall do this thing   his son   cried stubb   oh  it s his son he s lost 
i take back thecoat and watch what says ahab 
we must save that boy   he s drowned with the rest on  em  last night   said the old manxsailor standing behind them   i heard  all of ye heard their spirits  now  as it shortly turned out  what made this incident of the rachel sthe more melancholy  was the circumstance  that not only was one of thecaptain s sons among the number of the missing boat s crew  but amongthe number of the other boat s crews  at the same time  but on theother hand  separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of thechase  there had been still another son  as that for a time  thewretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity which was only solved for him by his chief mate s instinctivelyadopting the ordinary procedure of a whale ship in such emergencies that is  when placed between jeopardized but divided boats  always topick up the majority first 
but the captain  for some unknownconstitutional reason  had refrained from mentioning all this  and nottill forced to it by ahab s iciness did he allude to his one yetmissing boy  a little lad  but twelve years old  whose father with theearnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a nantucketer s paternal love  hadthus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of avocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race 
nor does itunfrequently occur  that nantucket captains will send a son of suchtender age away from them  for a protracted three or four years  voyagein some other ship than their own  so that their first knowledge of awhaleman s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of afather s natural but untimely partiality  or undue apprehensiveness andconcern meantime  now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of ahab and ahab still stood like an anvil  receiving every shock  but withoutthe least quivering of his own  i will not go   said the stranger   till you say aye to me 
do to meas you would have me do to you in the like case 
for you too have aboy  captain ahab though but a child  and nestling safely at home now achild of your old age too yes  yes  you relent  i see it run  run  men now  and stand by to square in the yards   avast   cried ahab  touch not a rope yarn   then in a voice thatprolongingly moulded every word  captain gardiner  i will not do it even now i lose time 
good bye  good bye 
god bless ye  man  and may iforgive myself  but i must go 
mr  starbuck  look at the binnaclewatch  and in three minutes from this present instant warn off allstrangers  then brace forward again  and let the ship sail as before  hurriedly turning  with averted face  he descended into his cabin leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utterrejection of his so earnest suit 
but starting from his enchantment gardiner silently hurried to the side  more fell than stepped into hisboat  and returned to his ship soon the two ships diverged their wakes  and long as the strange vesselwas in view  she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot however small  on the sea 
this way and that her yards were swunground  starboard and larboard  she continued to tack  now she beatagainst a head sea  and again it pushed her before it  while all thewhile  her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men  as threetall cherry trees  when the boys are cherrying among the boughs but by her still halting course and winding  woeful way  you plainlysaw that this ship that so wept with spray  still remained withoutcomfort

the hat and now that at the proper time and place  after so long and wide apreliminary cruise  ahab  all other whaling waters swept seemed to havechased his foe into an ocean fold  to slay him the more securely there now  that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitudewhere his tormenting wound had been inflicted  now that a vessel hadbeen spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encounteredmoby dick  and now that all his successive meetings with various shipscontrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with whichthe white whale tore his hunters  whether sinning or sinned against now it was that there lurked a something in the old man s eyes  whichit was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see 
as the unsettingpolar star  which through the livelong  arctic  six months  nightsustains its piercing  steady  central gaze  so ahab s purpose nowfixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew 
itdomineered above them so  that all their bodings  doubts  misgivings fears  were fain to hide beneath their souls  and not sprout forth asingle spear or leaf in this foreshadowing interval too  all humor  forced or natural vanished 
stubb no more strove to raise a smile  starbuck no morestrove to check one 
alike  joy and sorrow  hope and fear  seemedground to finest dust  and powdered  for the time  in the clampedmortar of ahab s iron soul 
like machines  they dumbly moved about thedeck  ever conscious that the old man s despot eye was on them but did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours  whenhe thought no glance but one was on him  then you would have seen thateven as ahab s eyes so awed the crew s  the inscrutable parsee s glanceawed his  or somehow  at least  in some wild way  at times affected it such an added  gliding strangeness began to invest the thin fedallahnow  such ceaseless shudderings shook him  that the men looked dubiousat him  half uncertain  as it seemed  whether indeed he were a mortalsubstance  or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseenbeing s body 
and that shadow was always hovering there 
for not bynight  even  had fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber  or gobelow 
he would stand still for hours  but never sat or leaned  his wanbut wondrous eyes did plainly say we two watchmen never rest nor  at any time  by night or day could the mariners now step upon thedeck  unless ahab was before them  either standing in his pivot hole or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits  themain mast and the mizen  or else they saw him standing in thecabin scuttle  his living foot advanced upon the deck  as if to step his hat slouched heavily over his eyes  so that however motionless hestood  however the days and nights were added on  that he had not swungin his hammock  yet hidden beneath that slouching hat  they could nevertell unerringly whether  for all this  his eyes were really closed attimes  or whether he was still intently scanning them  no matter though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch  andthe unheeded night damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone carvedcoat and hat 
the clothes that the night had wet  the next day ssunshine dried upon him  and so  day after day  and night after night he went no more beneath the planks  whatever he wanted from the cabinthat thing he sent for he ate in the same open air  that is  his two only meals  breakfast anddinner  supper he never touched  nor reaped his beard  which darklygrew all gnarled  as unearthed roots of trees blown over  which stillgrow idly on at naked base  though perished in the upper verdure 
butthough his whole life was now become one watch on deck  and though theparsee s mystic watch was without intermission as his own  yet thesetwo never seemed to speak one man to the other unless at long intervalssome passing unmomentous matter made it necessary 
though such a potentspell seemed secretly to join the twain  openly  and to the awe struckcrew  they seemed pole like asunder 
if by day they chanced to speakone word  by night  dumb men were both  so far as concerned theslightest verbal interchange 
at times  for longest hours  without asingle hail  they stood far parted in the starlight  ahab in hisscuttle  the parsee by the mainmast  but still fixedly gazing upon eachother  as if in the parsee ahab saw his forethrown shadow  in ahab theparsee his abandoned substance and yet  somehow  did ahab in his own proper self  as daily  hourly and every instant  commandingly revealed to his subordinates  ahabseemed an independent lord  the parsee but his slave 
still again bothseemed yoked together  and an unseen tyrant driving them  the leanshade siding the solid rib 
for be this parsee what he may  all rib andkeel was solid ahab at the first faintest glimmering of the dawn  his iron voice was heardfrom aft   man the mast heads   and all through the day  till aftersunset and after twilight  the same voice every hour  at the strikingof the helmsman s bell  was heard  what d ye see  sharp 
sharp  but when three or four days had slided by  after meeting thechildren seeking rachel  and no spout had yet been seen  the monomaniacold man seemed distrustful of his crew s fidelity  at least  of nearlyall except the pagan harpooneers  he seemed to doubt  even  whetherstubb and flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought 
butif these suspicions were really his  he sagaciously refrained fromverbally expressing them  however his actions might seem to hint them  i will have the first sight of the whale myself   he said 
ahabmust have the doubloon   and with his own hands he rigged a nest ofbasketed bowlines  and sending a hand aloft  with a single sheavedblock  to secure to the main mast head  he received the two ends of thedownward reeved rope  and attaching one to his basket prepared a pinfor the other end  in order to fasten it at the rail 
this done  withthat end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin  he looked roundupon his crew  sweeping from one to the other  pausing his glance longupon daggoo  queequeg  tashtego  but shunning fedallah  and thensettling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate  said   take therope  sir i give it into thy hands  starbuck   then arranging hisperson in the basket  he gave the word for them to hoist him to hisperch  starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last  andafterwards stood near it 
and thus  with one hand clinging round theroyal mast  ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles  ahead astern  this side  and that  within the wide expanded circle commandedat so great a height when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place inthe rigging  which chances to afford no foothold  the sailor at sea ishoisted up to that spot  and sustained there by the rope  under thesecircumstances  its fastened end on deck is always given in strictcharge to some one man who has the special watch of it 
because in sucha wilderness of running rigging  whose various different relationsaloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them atthe deck  and when the deck ends of these ropes are being every fewminutes cast down from the fastenings  it would be but a naturalfatality  if  unprovided with a constant watchman  the hoisted sailorshould by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall allswooping to the sea 
so ahab s proceedings in this matter were notunusual  the only strange thing about them seemed to be  that starbuck almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him withanything in the slightest degree approaching to decision one of thosetoo  whose faithfulness on the look out he had seemed to doubtsomewhat  it was strange  that this was the very man he should selectfor his watchman  freely giving his whole life into such an otherwisedistrusted person s hands now  the first time ahab was perched aloft  ere he had been there tenminutes  one of those red billed savage sea hawks which so often flyincommodiously close round the manned mast heads of whalemen in theselatitudes  one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round hishead in a maze of untrackably swift circlings 
then it darted athousand feet straight up into the air  then spiralized downwards  andwent eddying again round his head but with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon  ahab seemednot to mark this wild bird  nor  indeed  would any one else have markedit much  it being no uncommon circumstance  only now almost the leastheedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost everysight  your hat  your hat  sir   suddenly cried the sicilian seaman  whobeing posted at the mizen mast head  stood directly behind ahab  thoughsomewhat lower than his level  and with a deep gulf of air dividingthem but already the sable wing was before the old man s eyes  the longhooked bill at his head  with a scream  the black hawk darted away withhis prize an eagle flew thrice round tarquin s head  removing his cap to replaceit  and thereupon tanaquil  his wife  declared that tarquin would beking of rome 
but only by the replacing of the cap was that omenaccounted good 
ahab s hat was never restored  the wild hawk flew onand on with it  far in advance of the prow  and at last disappeared while from the point of that disappearance  a minute black spot wasdimly discerned  falling from that vast height into the sea chapter 131 
the pequod meets the delight the intense pequod sailed on  the rolling waves and days went by  thelife buoy coffin still lightly swung  and another ship  most miserablymisnamed the delight  was descried 
as she drew nigh  all eyes werefixed upon her broad beams  called shears  which  in somewhaling ships  cross the quarter deck at the height of eight or ninefeet  serving to carry the spare  unrigged  or disabled boats upon the stranger s shears were beheld the shattered  white ribs  andsome few splintered planks  of what had once been a whale boat  but younow saw through this wreck  as plainly as you see through the peeled half unhinged  and bleaching skeleton of a horse  hast seen the white whale   look   replied the hollow cheeked captain from his taffrail  and withhis trumpet he pointed to the wreck  hast killed him   the harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that   answered theother  sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck  whosegathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together  not forged   and snatching perth s levelled iron from the crotch  ahabheld it out  exclaiming  look ye  nantucketer  here in this hand i holdhis death 
tempered in blood  and tempered by lightning are thesebarbs  and i swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind thefin  where the white whale most feels his accursed life   then god keep thee  old man see st thou that  pointing to thehammock  i bury but one of five stout men  who were alive onlyyesterday  but were dead ere night 
only that one i bury  the restwere buried before they died  you sail upon their tomb   then turningto his crew  are ye ready there 
place the plank then on the rail  andlift the body  so  then oh 
god  advancing towards the hammock withuplifted hands  may the resurrection and the life    brace forward 
up helm   cried ahab like lightning to his men but the suddenly started pequod was not quick enough to escape thesound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea  notso quick  indeed  but that some of the flying bubbles might havesprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism as ahab now glided from the dejected delight  the strange life buoyhanging at the pequod s stern came into conspicuous relief  ha 
look yonder  men   cried a foreboding voice in her wake  in vain  oh  ye strangers  ye fly our sad burial  ye but turn us yourtaffrail to show us your coffin  chapter 132 
the symphony it was a clear steel blue day 
the firmaments of air and sea werehardly separable in that all pervading azure  only  the pensive air wastransparently pure and soft  with a woman s look  and the robust andman like sea heaved with long  strong  lingering swells  as samson schest in his sleep hither  and thither  on high  glided the snow white wings of small unspeckled birds  these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air but to and fro in the deeps  far down in the bottomless blue  rushedmighty leviathans  sword fish  and sharks  and these were the strong troubled  murderous thinkings of the masculine sea but though thus contrasting within  the contrast was only in shades andshadows without  those two seemed one  it was only the sex  as it were that distinguished them aloft  like a royal czar and king  the sun seemed giving this gentleair to this bold and rolling sea  even as bride to groom 
and at thegirdling line of the horizon  a soft and tremulous motion most seenhere at the equator denoted the fond  throbbing trust  the lovingalarms  with which the poor bride gave her bosom away tied up and twisted  gnarled and knotted with wrinkles  haggardly firmand unyielding  his eyes glowing like coals  that still glow in theashes of ruin  untottering ahab stood forth in the clearness of themorn  lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl sforehead of heaven oh  immortal infancy  and innocency of the azure 
invisible wingedcreatures that frolic all round us 
sweet childhood of air and sky 
howoblivious were ye of old ahab s close coiled woe 
but so have i seenlittle miriam and martha  laughing eyed elves  heedlessly gambol aroundtheir old sire  sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew onthe marge of that burnt out crater of his brain slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle  ahab leaned over the sideand watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze  themore and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity 
but thelovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel  for amoment  the cankerous thing in his soul 
that glad  happy air  thatwinsome sky  did at last stroke and caress him  the step mother world so long cruel forbidding now threw affectionate arms round his stubbornneck  and did seem to joyously sob over him  as if over one  thathowever wilful and erring  she could yet find it in her heart to saveand to bless 
from beneath his slouched hat ahab dropped a tear intothe sea  nor did all the pacific contain such wealth as that one weedrop starbuck saw the old man  saw him  how he heavily leaned over the side and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbingthat stole out of the centre of the serenity around 
careful not totouch him  or be noticed by him  he yet drew near to him  and stoodthere ahab turned  starbuck   sir   oh  starbuck 
it is a mild  mild wind  and a mild looking sky 
on sucha day very much such a sweetness as this i struck my first whale aboy harpooneer of eighteen 
forty forty forty years ago  ago 
fortyyears of continual whaling 
forty years of privation  and peril  andstorm time 
forty years on the pitiless sea 
for forty years has ahabforsaken the peaceful land  for forty years to make war on the horrorsof the deep 
aye and yes  starbuck  out of those forty years i have notspent three ashore 
when i think of this life i have led  thedesolation of solitude it has been  the masoned  walled town of acaptain s exclusiveness  which admits but small entrance to anysympathy from the green country without oh  weariness 
heaviness guinea coast slavery of solitary command  when i think of all this only half suspected  not so keenly known to me before and how for fortyyears i have fed upon dry salted fare fit emblem of the dry nourishmentof my soil  when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his dailyhand  and broken the world s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts away whole oceans away  from that young girl wife i wedded past fifty  andsailed for cape horn the next day  leaving but one dent in my marriagepillow wife

aye  iwidowed that poor girl when i married her  starbuck  and then  themadness  the frenzy  the boiling blood and the smoking brow  withwhich  for a thousand lowerings old ahab has furiously  foaminglychased his prey more a demon than a man  aye  aye 
what a forty years fool fool old fool  has old ahab been 
why this strife of the chase why weary  and palsy the arm at the oar  and the iron  and the lance how the richer or better is ahab now 
oh  starbuck 
is it nothard  that with this weary load i bear  one poor leg should have beensnatched from under me 
here  brush this old hair aside  it blinds me that i seem to weep 
locks so grey did never grow but from out someashes 
but do i look very old  so very  very old  starbuck 
i feeldeadly faint  bowed  and humped  as though i were adam  staggeringbeneath the piled centuries since paradise 
god  crack myheart  stave my brain  mockery 
bitter  biting mockery of greyhairs  have i lived enough joy to wear ye  and seem and feel thusintolerably old 
stand close to me  starbuck  let me look into ahuman eye  it is better than to gaze into sea or sky  better than togaze upon god 
by the green land  by the bright hearth stone 
this isthe magic glass  man  i see my wife and my child in thine eye 
no  no stay on board  on board  lower not when i do  when branded ahab giveschase to moby dick 
that hazard shall not be thine

let us away  this instant let me alterthe course 
how cheerily  how hilariously  o my captain  would we bowlon our way to see old nantucket again 
i think  sir  they have somesuch mild blue days  even as this  in nantucket   they have  they have 
i have seen them some summer days in themorning 
about this time yes  it is his noon nap now the boyvivaciously wakes  sits up in bed  and his mother tells him of me  ofcannibal old me  how i am abroad upon the deep  but will yet come backto dance him again    tis my mary  my mary herself 
she promised that my boy  everymorning  should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse ofhis father s sail 
yes  yes 
no more 
it is done 
we head fornantucket 
come  my captain  study out the course  and let us away see  see 
the boy s face from the window 
the boy s hand on the hill  but ahab s glance was averted  like a blighted fruit tree he shook  andcast his last  cindered apple to the soil  what is it  what nameless  inscrutable  unearthly thing is it  whatcozening  hidden lord and master  and cruel  remorseless emperorcommands me  that against all natural lovings and longings  i so keeppushing  and crowding  and jamming myself on all the time  recklesslymaking me ready to do what in my own proper  natural heart  i durst notso much as dare

who put it into him to chase and fang that flying fish 
wheredo murderers go  man 
who s to doom  when the judge himself is draggedto the bar 
but it is a mild  mild wind  and a mild looking sky  andthe air smells now  as if it blew from a far away meadow  they havebeen making hay somewhere under the slopes of the andes  starbuck  andthe mowers are sleeping among the new mown hay 
aye  toil wehow we may  we all sleep at last on the field 
aye  and rustamid greenness  as last year s scythes flung down  and left in thehalf cut swaths starbuck  but blanched to a corpse s hue with despair  the mate had stolen away ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side  but started attwo reflected  fixed eyes in the water there 
fedallah was motionlesslyleaning over the same rail chapter 133 
the chase first day that night  in the mid watch  when the old man as his wont atintervals stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned  and wentto his pivot hole  he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely  snuffingup the sea air as a sagacious ship s dog will  in drawing nigh to somebarbarous isle 
he declared that a whale must be near 
soon thatpeculiar odor  sometimes to a great distance given forth by the livingsperm whale  was palpable to all the watch  nor was any marinersurprised when  after inspecting the compass  and then the dog vane and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly aspossible  ahab rapidly ordered the ship s course to be slightlyaltered  and the sail to be shortened the acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicatedat daybreak  by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly andlengthwise ahead  smooth as oil  and resembling in the pleated waterywrinkles bordering it  the polished metallic like marks of some swifttide rip  at the mouth of a deep  rapid stream  man the mast heads 
call all hands  thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastledeck  daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that theyseemed to exhale from the scuttle  so instantaneously did they appearwith their clothes in their hands  what d ye see   cried ahab  flattening his face to the sky  nothing  nothing sir   was the sound hailing down in reply  t gallant sails  stunsails 
alow and aloft  and on both sides  all sail being set  he now cast loose the life line  reserved forswaying him to the main royal mast head  and in a few moments they werehoisting him thither  when  while but two thirds of the way aloft  andwhile peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between themain top sail and top gallant sail  he raised a gull like cry in theair 
 there she blows  there she blows 
a hump like a snow hill 
it ismoby dick  fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the threelook outs  the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famouswhale they had so long been pursuing 
ahab had now gained his finalperch  some feet above the other look outs  tashtego standing justbeneath him on the cap of the top gallant mast  so that the indian shead was almost on a level with ahab s heel 
from this height the whalewas now seen some mile or so ahead  at every roll of the sea revealinghis high sparkling hump  and regularly jetting his silent spout intothe air 
to the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout theyhad so long ago beheld in the moonlit atlantic and indian oceans  and did none of ye see it before   cried ahab  hailing the perched menall around him  i saw him almost that same instant  sir  that captain ahab did  and icried out   said tashtego  not the same instant  not the same no  the doubloon is mine  fatereserved the doubloon for me 
i only  none of ye could have raisedthe white whale first 
there she blows  there she blows  there sheblows 
there again  there again   he cried  in long drawn  lingering methodic tones  attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale svisible jets 
 he s going to sound 
in stunsails 
stand by three boats 
mr  starbuck  remember  stayon board  and keep the ship 
helm there 
luff  luff a point 
so steady  man  steady 
there go flukes 
no  no  only black water 
allready the boats there 
stand by  stand by 
lower me  mr  starbuck lower  lower  quick  quicker   and he slid through the air to the deck  he is heading straight to leeward  sir   cried stubb   right away fromus  cannot have seen the ship yet   be dumb  man 
stand by the braces 
hard down the helm  brace up shiver her  shiver her  so  well that 
boats  boats  soon all the boats but starbuck s were dropped  all the boat sailsset all the paddles plying  with rippling swiftness  shooting toleeward  and ahab heading the onset 
a pale  death glimmer lit upfedallah s sunken eyes  a hideous motion gnawed his mouth like noiseless nautilus shells  their light prows sped through the sea but only slowly they neared the foe 
as they neared him  the ocean grewstill more smooth  seemed drawing a carpet over its waves  seemed anoon meadow  so serenely it spread 
at length the breathless huntercame so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey  that his entire dazzlinghump was distinctly visible  sliding along the sea as if an isolatedthing  and continually set in a revolving ring of finest  fleecy greenish foam 
he saw the vast  involved wrinkles of the slightlyprojecting head beyond 
before it  far out on the soft turkish ruggedwaters  went the glistening white shadow from his broad  milkyforehead  a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade  andbehind  the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the movingvalley of his steady wake  and on either hand bright bubbles arose anddanced by his side 
but these were broken again by the light toes ofhundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea  alternate with theirfitful flight  and like to some flag staff rising from the painted hullof an argosy  the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projectedfrom the white whale s back  and at intervals one of the cloud ofsoft toed fowls hovering  and to and fro skimming like a canopy overthe fish  silently perched and rocked on this pole  the long tailfeathers streaming like pennons a gentle joyousness a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness  investedthe gliding whale 
not the white bull jupiter swimming away withravished europa clinging to his graceful horns  his lovely  leeringeyes sideways intent upon the maid  with smooth bewitching fleetness rippling straight for the nuptial bower in crete  not jove  not thatgreat majesty supreme 
did surpass the glorified white whale as he sodivinely swam on each soft side coincident with the parted swell  that but onceleaving him  then flowed so wide away on each bright side  the whaleshed off enticings 
no wonder there had been some among the hunters whonamelessly transported and allured by all this serenity  had venturedto assail it  but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture oftornadoes 
yet calm  enticing calm  oh  whale 
thou glidest on  to allwho for the first time eye thee  no matter how many in that same waythou may st have bejuggled and destroyed before and thus  through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea  amongwaves whose hand clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture  mobydick moved on  still withholding from sight the full terrors of hissubmerged trunk  entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw but soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water  for aninstant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch  like virginia snatural bridge  and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air the grand god revealed himself  sounded  and went out of sight hoveringly halting  and dipping on the wing  the white sea fowlslongingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left with oars apeak  and paddles down  the sheets of their sails adrift the three boats now stilly floated  awaiting moby dick s reappearance  an hour   said ahab  standing rooted in his boat s stern  and he gazedbeyond the whale s place  towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooingvacancies to leeward 
it was only an instant  for again his eyes seemedwhirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle 
the breezenow freshened  the sea began to swell  the birds  the birds   cried tashtego in long indian file  as when herons take wing  the white birds were nowall flying towards ahab s boat  and when within a few yards beganfluttering over the water there  wheeling round and round  with joyous expectant cries 
their vision was keener than man s  ahab coulddiscover no sign in the sea 
but suddenly as he peered down and downinto its depths  he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than awhite weasel  with wonderful celerity uprising  and magnifying as itrose  till it turned  and then there were plainly revealed two longcrooked rows of white  glistening teeth  floating up from theundiscoverable bottom 
it was moby dick s open mouth and scrolled jaw his vast  shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea the glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open doored marbletomb  and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar  ahab whirledthe craft aside from this tremendous apparition 
then  calling uponfedallah to change places with him  went forward to the bows  andseizing perth s harpoon  commanded his crew to grasp their oars andstand by to stern now  by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis its bow  by anticipation  was made to face the whale s head while yetunder water 
but as if perceiving this stratagem  moby dick  with thatmalicious intelligence ascribed to him  sidelingly transplantedhimself  as it were  in an instant  shooting his pleated headlengthwise beneath the boat through and through  through every plank and each rib  it thrilled foran instant  the whale obliquely lying on his back  in the manner of abiting shark  slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within hismouth  so that the long  narrow  scrolled lower jaw curled high up intothe open air  and one of the teeth caught in a row lock 
the bluishpearl white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of ahab shead  and reached higher than that 
in this attitude the white whalenow shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse 
withunastonished eyes fedallah gazed  and crossed his arms  but thetiger yellow crew were tumbling over each other s heads to gain theuttermost stern and now  while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out  as thewhale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way  and from hisbody being submerged beneath the boat  he could not be darted at fromthe bows  for the bows were almost inside of him  as it were  and whilethe other boats involuntarily paused  as before a quick crisisimpossible to withstand  then it was that monomaniac ahab  furious withthis tantalizing vicinity of his foe  which placed him all alive andhelpless in the very jaws he hated  frenzied with all this  he seizedthe long bone with his naked hands  and wildly strove to wrench it fromits gripe 
as now he thus vainly strove  the jaw slipped from him  thefrail gunwales bent in  collapsed  and snapped  as both jaws  like anenormous shears  sliding further aft  bit the craft completely intwain  and locked themselves fast again in the sea  midway between thetwo floating wrecks 
these floated aside  the broken ends drooping  thecrew at the stern wreck clinging to the gunwales  and striving to holdfast to the oars to lash them across at that preluding moment  ere the boat was yet snapped  ahab  the firstto perceive the whale s intent  by the crafty upraising of his head  amovement that loosed his hold for the time  at that moment his hand hadmade one final effort to push the boat out of the bite 
but onlyslipping further into the whale s mouth  and tilting over sideways asit slipped  the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw  spilled himout of it  as he leaned to the push  and so he fell flat faced upon thesea ripplingly withdrawing from his prey  moby dick now lay at a littledistance  vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in thebillows  and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose some twenty or more feetout of the water the now rising swells  with all their confluent waves dazzlingly broke against it  vindictively tossing their shivered spraystill higher into the air 
  so  in a gale  the but half baffled channelbillows only recoil from the base of the eddystone  triumphantly tooverleap its summit with their scud 
 this motion is peculiar to the sperm whale 
it receives itsdesignation  pitchpoling  from its being likened to that preliminaryup and down poise of the whale lance  in the exercise calledpitchpoling  previously described 
by this motion the whale must bestand most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him but soon resuming his horizontal attitude  moby dick swam swiftly roundand round the wrecked crew  sideways churning the water in his vengefulwake  as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadlyassault 
the sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him  as theblood of grapes and mulberries cast before antiochus s elephants in thebook of maccabees 
meanwhile ahab half smothered in the foam of thewhale s insolent tail  and too much of a cripple to swim  though hecould still keep afloat  even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that helpless ahab s head was seen  like a tossed bubble which the leastchance shock might burst 
from the boat s fragmentary stern  fedallahincuriously and mildly eyed him  the clinging crew  at the otherdrifting end  could not succor him  more than enough was it for them tolook to themselves 
for so revolvingly appalling was the white whale saspect  and so planetarily swift the ever contracting circles he made that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them 
and though the otherboats  unharmed  still hovered hard by  still they dared not pull intothe eddy to strike  lest that should be the signal for the instantdestruction of the jeopardized castaways  ahab and all  nor in thatcase could they themselves hope to escape 
with straining eyes  then they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone  whose centre hadnow become the old man s head meantime  from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship smast heads  and squaring her yards  she had borne down upon the scene and was now so nigh  that ahab in the water hailed her   sail onthe  but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from moby dick  andwhelmed him for the time 
but struggling out of it again  and chancingto rise on a towering crest  he shouted   sail on the whale  drive himoff  the pequod s prows were pointed  and breaking up the charmed circle she effectually parted the white whale from his victim 
as he sullenlyswam off  the boats flew to the rescue dragged into stubb s boat with blood shot  blinded eyes  the whitebrine caking in his wrinkles  the long tension of ahab s bodilystrength did crack  and helplessly he yielded to his body s doom  for atime  lying all crushed in the bottom of stubb s boat  like one troddenunder foot of herds of elephants 
far inland  nameless wails came fromhim  as desolate sounds from out ravines but this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the moreabbreviate it 
in an instant s compass  great hearts sometimes condenseto one deep pang  the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffusedthrough feebler men s whole lives 
and so  such hearts  though summaryin each one suffering  still  if the gods decree it  in their life timeaggregate a whole age of woe  wholly made up of instantaneousintensities  for even in their pointless centres  those noble naturescontain the entire circumferences of inferior souls  the harpoon   said ahab  half way rising  and draggingly leaning onone bended arm  is it safe   aye  sir  for it was not darted  this is it   said stubb  showing it  lay it before me  any missing men   one  two  three  four  five  there were five oars  sir  and here arefive men   that s good  help me  man  i wish to stand 
so  so  i see him 
going to leeward still  what a leaping spout  hands off from me the eternal sap runs up in ahab s bones again 
set the sail  out oars the helm  it is often the case that when a boat is stove  its crew  being pickedup by another boat  help to work that second boat  and the chase isthus continued with what is called double banked oars 
it was thus now but the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of thewhale  for he seemed to have treble banked his every fin  swimming witha velocity which plainly showed  that if now  under thesecircumstances  pushed on  the chase would prove an indefinitelyprolonged  if not a hopeless one  nor could any crew endure for so longa period  such an unintermitted  intense straining at the oar  a thingbarely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude 
the ship itself then  as it sometimes happens  offered the most promising intermediatemeans of overtaking the chase 
accordingly  the boats now made for her and were soon swayed up to their cranes the two parts of the wreckedboat having been previously secured by her and then hoisting everythingto her side  and stacking her canvas high up  and sidewaysoutstretching it with stun sails  like the double jointed wings of analbatross  the pequod bore down in the leeward wake of moby dick 
atthe well known  methodic intervals  the whale s glittering spout wasregularly announced from the manned mast heads  and when he would bereported as just gone down  ahab would take the time  and then pacingthe deck  binnacle watch in hand  so soon as the last second of theallotted hour expired  his voice was heard   whose is the doubloon now d ye see him   and if the reply was  no  sir 
straightway he commandedthem to lift him to his perch 
in this way the day wore on  ahab  nowaloft and motionless  anon  unrestingly pacing the planks as he was thus walking  uttering no sound  except to hail the menaloft  or to bid them hoist a sail still higher  or to spread one to astill greater breadth thus to and fro pacing  beneath his slouched hat at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat  which had been droppedupon the quarter deck  and lay there reversed  broken bow to shatteredstern 
at last he paused before it  and as in an already over cloudedsky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across  so over the oldman s face there now stole some such added gloom as this stubb saw him pause  and perhaps intending  not vainly  though  toevince his own unabated fortitude  and thus keep up a valiant place inhis captain s mind  he advanced  and eyeing the wreck exclaimed  thethistle the ass refused  it pricked his mouth too keenly  sir  ha 
ha   what soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck 
man  man 
didi not know thee brave as fearless fire  and as mechanical  i couldswear thou wert a poltroon 
groan nor laugh should be heard before awreck   aye  sir   said starbuck drawing near    tis a solemn sight  an omen and an ill one   omen 
omen  the dictionary 
if the gods think to speak outright toman  they will honorably speak outright  not shake their heads  andgive an old wives  darkling hint  begone 
ye two are the opposite polesof one thing  starbuck is stubb reversed  and stubb is starbuck  and yetwo are all mankind  and ahab stands alone among the millions of thepeopled earth  nor gods nor men his neighbors 
cold  cold i shiver  hownow 
aloft there 
d ye see him 
sing out for every spout  though hespout ten times a second  the day was nearly done  only the hem of his golden robe was rustling soon  it was almost dark  but the look out men still remained unset  can t see the spout now  sir  too dark  cried a voice from the air  how heading when last seen   as before  sir  straight to leeward   good 
he will travel slower now  tis night 
down royals andtop gallant stun sails  mr  starbuck 
we must not run over him beforemorning  he s making a passage now  and may heave to a while 
keep her full before the wind  aloft 
come down  mr 
stubb  senda fresh hand to the fore mast head  and see it manned tillmorning   then advancing towards the doubloon in the main mast  men this gold is mine  for i earned it  but i shall let it abide here tillthe white whale is dead  and then  whosoever of ye first raises him upon the day he shall be killed  this gold is that man s  and if onthat day i shall again raise him  then  ten times its sum shall bedivided among all of ye 
away now  the deck is thine  sir  and so saying  he placed himself half way within the scuttle  andslouching his hat  stood there till dawn  except when at intervalsrousing himself to see how the night wore on chapter 134 
the chase second day at day break  the three mast heads were punctually manned afresh  d ye see him   cried ahab after allowing a little space for the lightto spread  see nothing  sir   turn up all hands and make sail 
he travels faster than i thoughtfor  the top gallant sails  aye  they should have been kept on her allnight 
but no matter  tis but resting for the rush  here be it said  that this pertinacious pursuit of one particularwhale  continued through day into night  and through night into day  isa thing by no means unprecedented in the south sea fishery 
for such isthe wonderful skill  prescience of experience  and invincibleconfidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the nantucketcommanders  that from the simple observation of a whale when lastdescried  they will  under certain given circumstances  prettyaccurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue toswim for a time  while out of sight  as well as his probable rate ofprogression during that period 
and  in these cases  somewhat as apilot  when about losing sight of a coast  whose general trending hewell knows  and which he desires shortly to return to again  but atsome further point  like as this pilot stands by his compass  and takesthe precise bearing of the cape at present visible  in order the morecertainly to hit aright the remote  unseen headland  eventually to bevisited  so does the fisherman  at his compass  with the whale  forafter being chased  and diligently marked  through several hours ofdaylight  then  when night obscures the fish  the creature s futurewake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagaciousmind of the hunter  as the pilot s coast is to him 
so that to thishunter s wondrous skill  the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ inwater  a wake  is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as thesteadfast land 
and as the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railwayis so familiarly known in its every pace  that  with watches in theirhands  men time his rate as doctors that of a baby s pulse  and lightlysay of it  the up train or the down train will reach such or such aspot  at such or such an hour  even so  almost  there are occasionswhen these nantucketers time that other leviathan of the deep according to the observed humor of his speed  and say to themselves  somany hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles  will haveabout reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude 
but torender this acuteness at all successful in the end  the wind and thesea must be the whaleman s allies  for of what present avail to thebecalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he isexactly ninety three leagues and a quarter from his port 
inferablefrom these statements  are many collateral subtile matters touching thechase of whales the ship tore on  leaving such a furrow in the sea as when acannon ball  missent  becomes a plough share and turns up the levelfield  by salt and hemp   cried stubb   but this swift motion of the deckcreeps up one s legs and tingles at the heart 
this ship and i are twobrave fellows  ha  ha 
some one take me up  and launch me  spine wise on the sea  for by live oaks 
my spine s a keel 
ha  ha 
we go the gaitthat leaves no dust behind   there she blows she blows  she blows  right ahead   was now themast head cry  aye  aye   cried stubb   i knew it ye can t escape blow on and splityour spout  o whale 
the mad fiend himself is after ye 
blow yourtrump blister your lungs  ahab will dam off your blood  as a millershuts his watergate upon the stream  and stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew 
the frenziesof the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up  like old wineworked anew 
whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them mighthave felt before  these were not only now kept out of sight through thegrowing awe of ahab  but they were broken up  and on all sides routed as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison 
the handof fate had snatched all their souls  and by the stirring perils of theprevious day  the rack of the past night s suspense  the fixed unfearing  blind  reckless way in which their wild craft went plungingtowards its flying mark  by all these things  their hearts were bowledalong 
the wind that made great bellies of their sails  and rushed thevessel on by arms invisible as irresistible  this seemed the symbol ofthat unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race they were one man  not thirty 
for as the one ship that held them all though it was put together of all contrasting things oak  and maple and pine wood  iron  and pitch  and hemp yet all these ran into eachother in the one concrete hull  which shot on its way  both balancedand directed by the long central keel  even so  all the individualitiesof the crew  this man s valor  that man s fear  guilt and guiltiness all varieties were welded into oneness  and were all directed to thatfatal goal which ahab their one lord and keel did point to the rigging lived 
the mast heads  like the tops of tall palms  wereoutspreadingly tufted with arms and legs 
clinging to a spar with onehand  some reached forth the other with impatient wavings  others shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight  sat far out on the rockingyards  all the spars in full bearing of mortals  ready and ripe fortheir fate 
how they still strove through that infinite blueness toseek out the thing that might destroy them  why sing ye not out for him  if ye see him   cried ahab  when  afterthe lapse of some minutes since the first cry  no more had been heard  sway me up  men  ye have been deceived  not moby dick casts one oddjet that way  and then disappears  it was even so  in their headlong eagerness  the men had mistaken someother thing for the whale spout  as the event itself soon proved  forhardly had ahab reached his perch  hardly was the rope belayed to itspin on deck  when he struck the key note to an orchestra  that made theair vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles 
the triumphanthalloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard  as much nearer to the shipthan the place of the imaginary jet  less than a mile ahead moby dickbodily burst into view 
for not by any calm and indolent spoutings  notby the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head  did thewhite whale now reveal his vicinity  but by the far more wondrousphenomenon of breaching 
rising with his utmost velocity from thefurthest depths  the sperm whale thus booms his entire bulk into thepure element of air  and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam  showshis place to the distance of seven miles and more 
in those moments the torn  enraged waves he shakes off  seem his mane  in some cases this breaching is his act of defiance  there she breaches 
there she breaches   was the cry  as in hisimmeasurable bravadoes the white whale tossed himself salmon like toheaven 
so suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea  and relievedagainst the still bluer margin of the sky  the spray that he raised for the moment  intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier  andstood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparklingintensity  to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale  aye  breach your last to the sun  moby dick   cried ahab   thy hourand thy harpoon are at hand  down 
down all of ye  but one man at thefore 
the boats  stand by  unmindful of the tedious rope ladders of the shrouds  the men  likeshooting stars  slid to the deck  by the isolated backstays andhalyards  while ahab  less dartingly  but still rapidly was droppedfrom his perch  lower away   he cried  so soon as he had reached his boat a spare one rigged the afternoon previous 
starbuck  the ship is thine keepaway from the boats  but keep near them 
lower  all  as if to strike a quick terror into them  by this time being the firstassailant himself  moby dick had turned  and was now coming for thethree crews 
ahab s boat was central  and cheering his men  he toldthem he would take the whale head and head  that is  pull straight upto his forehead  a not uncommon thing  for when within a certain limit such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale s sidelongvision 
but ere that close limit was gained  and while yet all threeboats were plain as the ship s three masts to his eye  the white whalechurning himself into furious speed  almost in an instant as it were rushing among the boats with open jaws  and a lashing tail  offeredappalling battle on every side  and heedless of the irons darted at himfrom every boat  seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plankof which those boats were made 
but skilfully manœuvred  incessantlywheeling like trained chargers in the field  the boats for a whileeluded him  though  at times  but by a plank s breadth  while all thetime  ahab s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds but at last in his untraceable evolutions  the white whale so crossedand recrossed  and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the threelines now fast to him  that they foreshortened  and  of themselves warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him  though nowfor a moment the whale drew aside a little  as if to rally for a moretremendous charge 
seizing that opportunity  ahab first paid out moreline  and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again hopingthat way to disencumber it of some snarls when lo  a sight more savagethan the embattled teeth of sharks caught and twisted corkscrewed in the mazes of the line  loose harpoonsand lances  with all their bristling barbs and points  came flashingand dripping up to the chocks in the bows of ahab s boat 
only onething could be done 
seizing the boat knife  he critically reachedwithin through and then  without the rays of steel  dragged in the linebeyond  passed it  inboard  to the bowsman  and then  twice sunderingthe rope near the chocks dropped the intercepted fagot of steel intothe sea  and was all fast again 
that instant  the white whale made asudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines  by sodoing  irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of stubb and flasktowards his flukes  dashed them together like two rolling husks on asurf beaten beach  and then  diving down into the sea  disappeared in aboiling maelstrom  in which  for a space  the odorous cedar chips ofthe wrecks danced round and round  like the grated nutmeg in a swiftlystirred bowl of punch while the two crews were yet circling in the waters  reaching out afterthe revolving line tubs  oars  and other floating furniture  whileaslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial  twitchinghis legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks  and stubb waslustily singing out for some one to ladle him up  and while the oldman s line now parting admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool torescue whom he could  in that wild simultaneousness of a thousandconcreted perils  ahab s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towardsheaven by invisible wires  as  arrow like  shooting perpendicularlyfrom the sea  the white whale dashed his broad forehead against itsbottom  and sent it  turning over and over  into the air  till it fellagain gunwale downwards and ahab and his men struggled out from underit  like seals from a sea side cave the first uprising momentum of the whale modifying its direction as hestruck the surface involuntarily launched him along it  to a littledistance from the centre of the destruction he had made  and with hisback to it  he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes fromside to side  and whenever a stray oar  bit of plank  the least chip orcrumb of the boats touched his skin  his tail swiftly drew back  andcame sideways smiting the sea 
but soon  as if satisfied that his workfor that time was done  he pushed his pleated forehead through theocean  and trailing after him the intertangled lines  continued hisleeward way at a traveller s methodic pace as before  the attentive ship having descried the whole fight  againcame bearing down to the rescue  and dropping a boat  picked up thefloating mariners  tubs  oars  and whatever else could be caught at and safely landed them on her decks 
some sprained shoulders  wrists and ankles  livid contusions  wrenched harpoons and lances inextricable intricacies of rope  shattered oars and planks  all thesewere there  but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallenany one 
as with fedallah the day before  so ahab was now found grimlyclinging to his boat s broken half  which afforded a comparatively easyfloat  nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day s mishap but when he was helped to the deck  all eyes were fastened upon him  asinstead of standing by himself he still half hung upon the shoulder ofstarbuck  who had thus far been the foremost to assist him 
his ivoryleg had been snapped off  leaving but one short sharp splinter  aye  aye  starbuck   tis sweet to lean sometimes  be the leaner who hewill  and would old ahab had leaned oftener than he has   the ferrule has not stood  sir   said the carpenter  now coming up   iput good work into that leg   but no bones broken  sir  i hope   said stubb with true concern  aye 
and all splintered to pieces  stubb  d ye see it  but even with abroken bone  old ahab is untouched  and i account no living bone ofmine one jot more me  than this dead one that s lost 
nor white whale nor man  nor fiend  can so much as graze old ahab in his own proper andinaccessible being 
can any lead touch yonder floor  any mast scrapeyonder roof  aloft there 
which way   dead to leeward  sir   up helm  then  pile on the sail again  ship keepers 
down the rest ofthe spare boats and rig them mr 
starbuck away  and muster the boat screws   let me first help thee towards the bulwarks  sir   oh  oh  oh 
how this splinter gores me now 
accursed fate 
that theunconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate   sir   my body  man  not thee 
give me something for a cane there  thatshivered lance will do 
muster the men 
surely i have not seen him yet by heaven it cannot be  missing  quick 
call them all  the old man s hinted thought was true 
upon mustering the company  theparsee was not there  the parsee   cried stubb  he must have been caught in    the black vomit wrench thee  run all of ye above  alow  cabin forecastle find him not gone not gone  but quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the parsee wasnowhere to be found  aye  sir   said stubb  caught among the tangles of your line i thoughti saw him dragging under   my line 
my line 
what means that little word  whatdeath knell rings in it  that old ahab shakes as if he were the belfry the harpoon  too  toss over the litter there  d ye see it  the forgediron  men  the white whale s no  no  no  blistered fool 
this hand diddart it   tis in the fish  aloft there 
keep him nailed quick  allhands to the rigging of the boats collect the oars harpooneers 
theirons  the irons  hoist the royals higher a pull on all thesheets  helm there 
steady  steady for your life 
i ll ten times girdlethe unmeasured globe  yea and dive straight through it  but i ll slayhim yet   great god 
but for one single instant show thyself   cried starbuck  never  never wilt thou capture him  old man in jesus  name no more ofthis  that s worse than devil s madness 
two days chased  twice stoveto splinters  thy very leg once more snatched from under thee  thy evilshadow gone all good angels mobbing thee with warnings  what morewouldst thou have  shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till heswamps the last man 
shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of thesea 
shall we be towed by him to the infernal world 
oh  oh  impietyand blasphemy to hunt him more   starbuck  of late i ve felt strangely moved to thee  ever since thathour we both saw thou know st what  in one another s eyes 
but in thismatter of the whale  be the front of thy face to me as the palm of thishand a lipless  unfeatured blank 
ahab is for ever ahab  man 
thiswhole act s immutably decreed 
 twas rehearsed by thee and me a billionyears before this ocean rolled 
i am the fates  lieutenant  i actunder orders 
look thou  underling 
that thou obeyest mine  stand roundme  men 
ye see an old man cut down to the stump  leaning on a shiveredlance  propped up on a lonely foot 
 tis ahab his body s part  butahab s soul s a centipede  that moves upon a hundred legs 
i feelstrained  half stranded  as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in agale  and i may look so 
but ere i break  ye ll hear me crack  and tillye hear that  know that ahab s hawser tows his purpose yet 
believeye  men  in the things called omens 
then laugh aloud  and cry encore for ere they drown  drowning things will twice rise to the surface then rise again  to sink for evermore 
so with moby dick two days he sfloated tomorrow will be the third 
aye  men  he ll rise once more  butonly to spout his last 
d ye feel brave men  brave   as fearless fire   cried stubb  and as mechanical   muttered ahab 
then as the men went forward  hemuttered on   the things called omens 
and yesterday i talked the sameto starbuck there  concerning my broken boat 
how valiantly i seekto drive out of others  hearts what s clinched so fast in mine  theparsee the parsee  gone  gone 
and he was to go before  but still wasto be seen again ere i could perish how s that  there s a riddle nowmight baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line ofjudges  like a hawk s beak it pecks my brain 
i ll  i ll solve it though  when dusk descended  the whale was still in sight to leeward so once more the sail was shortened  and everything passed nearly as onthe previous night  only  the sound of hammers  and the hum of thegrindstone was heard till nearly daylight  as the men toiled bylanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats andsharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow 
meantime  of the brokenkeel of ahab s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg  whilestill as on the night before  slouched ahab stood fixed within hisscuttle  his hid  heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on itsdial  sat due eastward for the earliest sun chapter 135 
the chase  third day the morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh  and once more thesolitary night man at the fore mast head was relieved by crowds of thedaylight look outs  who dotted every mast and almost every spar  d ye see him   cried ahab  but the whale was not yet in sight  in his infallible wake  though  but follow that wake  that s all 
helmthere  steady  as thou goest  and hast been going 
what a lovely dayagain 
were it a new made world  and made for a summer house to theangels  and this morning the first of its throwing open to them  afairer day could not dawn upon that world 
here s food for thought  hadahab time to think  but ahab never thinks  he only feels  feels  feels that s tingling enough for mortal man 
to think s audacity 
god onlyhas that right and privilege 
thinking is  or ought to be  a coolnessand a calmness  and our poor hearts throb  and our poor brains beat toomuch for that 
and yet  i ve sometimes thought my brain was verycalm frozen calm  this old skull cracks so  like a glass in which thecontents turned to ice  and shiver it 
and still this hair is growingnow  this moment growing  and heat must breed it  but no  it s likethat sort of common grass that will grow anywhere  between the earthyclefts of greenland ice or in vesuvius lava 
how the wild winds blowit  they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash thetossed ship they cling to 
a vile wind that has no doubt blown ere thisthrough prison corridors and cells  and wards of hospitals  andventilated them  and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces out upon it  it s tainted 
were i the wind  i d blow no more on such awicked  miserable world 
i d crawl somewhere to a cave  and slinkthere 
and yet   tis a noble and heroic thing  the wind 
who everconquered it 
in every fight it has the last and bitterest blow 
runtilting at it  and you but run through it 
a coward wind thatstrikes stark naked men  but will not stand to receive a single blow even ahab is a braver thing a nobler thing than that 
would now thewind but had a body  but all the things that most exasperate andoutrage mortal man  all these things are bodiless  but only bodiless asobjects  not as agents 
there s a most special  a most cunning  oh  amost malicious difference 
and yet  i say again  and swear it now  thatthere s something all glorious and gracious in the wind 
these warmtrade winds  at least  that in the clear heavens blow straight on  instrong and steadfast  vigorous mildness  and veer not from their mark however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack  and mightiestmississippies of the land swift and swerve about  uncertain where to goat last 
and by the eternal poles 
these same trades that so directlyblow my good ship on  these trades  or something like them something sounchangeable  and full as strong  blow my keeled soul along 
to it aloft there 
what d ye see   nothing  sir   nothing 
and noon at hand 
the doubloon goes a begging 
see the sun aye  aye  it must be so 
i ve oversailed him 
how  got the start 
aye he s chasing me now  not i  him that s bad  i might have known it too 
the lines the harpoons he s towing 
aye  aye  i have run himby last night 
come down  all of ye  but the regular lookouts 
man the braces  steering as she had done  the wind had been somewhat on the pequod squarter  so that now being pointed in the reverse direction  the bracedship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her ownwhite wake  against the wind he now steers for the open jaw   murmured starbuck tohimself  as he coiled the new hauled main brace upon the rail 
 godkeep us  but already my bones feel damp within me  and from the insidewet my flesh 
i misdoubt me that i disobey my god in obeying him   stand by to sway me up   cried ahab  advancing to the hempen basket  we should meet him soon   aye  aye  sir   and straightway starbuck did ahab s bidding  and oncemore ahab swung on high a whole hour now passed  gold beaten out to ages 
time itself now heldlong breaths with keen suspense 
but at last  some three points off theweather bow  ahab descried the spout again  and instantly from thethree mast heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire hadvoiced it  forehead to forehead i meet thee  this third time  moby dick 
on deckthere  brace sharper up  crowd her into the wind s eye 
he s too faroff to lower yet  mr  starbuck 
the sails shake

so  so  he travels fast  and i must down 
butlet me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea  there stime for that 
an old  old sight  and yet somehow so young  aye  andnot changed a wink since i first saw it  a boy  from the sand hills ofnantucket 
the same  the same  the same to noah as to me 
there s asoft shower to leeward 
such lovely leewardings 
they must leadsomewhere to something else than common land  more palmy than thepalms 
the white whale goes that way  look to windward  then the better if the bitterer quarter 
but good bye  good bye  oldmast head 
what s this  green 
aye  tiny mosses in these warped cracks no such green weather stains on ahab s head 
there s the difference nowbetween man s old age and matter s 
but aye  old mast  we both grow oldtogether  sound in our hulls  though  are we not  my ship 
aye  minus aleg  that s all 
by heaven this dead wood has the better of my liveflesh every way 
i can t compare with it  and i ve known some shipsmade of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vitalstuff of vital fathers 
what s that he said 
he should still go beforeme  my pilot  and yet to be seen again 
but where 
will i have eyes atthe bottom of the sea  supposing i descend those endless stairs 
andall night i ve been sailing from him  wherever he did sink to 
aye aye  like many more thou told st direful truth as touching thyself  oparsee  but  ahab  there thy shot fell short 
good bye  mast head keepa good eye upon the whale  the while i m gone 
we ll talk to morrow nay  to night  when the white whale lies down there  tied by head andtail  he gave the word  and still gazing round him  was steadily loweredthrough the cloven blue air to the deck in due time the boats were lowered  but as standing in his shallop sstern  ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent  he waved to themate  who held one of the tackle ropes on deck and bade him pause  starbuck   sir   for the third time my soul s ship starts upon this voyage  starbuck   aye  sir  thou wilt have it so   some ships sail from their ports  and ever afterwards are missing starbuck   truth  sir  saddest truth   some men die at ebb tide  some at low water  some at the full of theflood  and i feel now like a billow that s all one crested comb starbuck 
i am old  shake hands with me  man  their hands met  their eyes fastened  starbuck s tears the glue  oh  my captain  my captain  noble heart go not go not  see  it s abrave man that weeps  how great the agony of the persuasion then   lower away   cried ahab  tossing the mate s arm from him 
 stand bythe crew  in an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern  the sharks 
the sharks   cried a voice from the low cabin windowthere   o master  my master  come back  but ahab heard nothing  for his own voice was high lifted then  and theboat leaped on yet the voice spake true  for scarce had he pushed from the ship  whennumbers of sharks  seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneaththe hull  maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars  every timethey dipped in the water  and in this way accompanied the boat withtheir bites 
it is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale boatsin those swarming seas  the sharks at times apparently following themin the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners ofmarching regiments in the east 
but these were the first sharks thathad been observed by the pequod since the white whale had been firstdescried  and whether it was that ahab s crew were all suchtiger yellow barbarians  and therefore their flesh more musky to thesenses of the sharks a matter sometimes well known to affectthem  however it was  they seemed to follow that one boat withoutmolesting the others  heart of wrought steel   murmured starbuck gazing over the side  andfollowing with his eyes the receding boat  canst thou yet ring boldlyto that sight  lowering thy keel among ravening sharks  and followed bythem  open mouthed to the chase  and this the critical third day  forwhen three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit  besure the first is the morning  the second the noon  and the third theevening and the end of that thing be that end what it may 
my god what is this that shoots through me  and leaves me so deadly calm  yetexpectant  fixed at the top of a shudder 
future things swim before me as in empty outlines and skeletons  all the past is somehow grown dim mary  girl 
thou fadest in pale glories behind me  boy 
i seem to seebut thy eyes grown wondrous blue 
strangest problems of life seemclearing  but clouds sweep between is my journey s end coming 
my legsfeel faint  like his who has footed it all day 
feel thy heart  beatsit yet 
stir thyself  starbuck  stave it off move  move 
speakaloud  mast head there 
see ye my boy s hand on the hill  crazed  aloftthere  keep thy keenest eye upon the boats  mark well the whale  ho again  drive off that hawk 
he pecks he tears the vane  pointingto the red flag flying at the main truck  ha 
he soars away withit  where s the old man now 
see st thou that sight  oh ahab  shudder shudder  the boats had not gone very far  when by a signal from the mast heads adownward pointed arm  ahab knew that the whale had sounded  butintending to be near him at the next rising  he held on his way alittle sideways from the vessel  the becharmed crew maintaining theprofoundest silence  as the head beat waves hammered and hammeredagainst the opposing bow  drive  drive in your nails  oh ye waves 
to their uttermost headsdrive them in 
ye but strike a thing without a lid  and no coffin andno hearse can be mine  and hemp only can kill me 
ha  suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles  thenquickly upheaved  as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice swiftly rising to the surface 
a low rumbling sound was heard  asubterraneous hum  and then all held their breaths  as bedraggled withtrailing ropes  and harpoons  and lances  a vast form shot lengthwise but obliquely from the sea 
shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air  and then fell swampingback into the deep 
crushed thirty feet upwards  the waters flashed foran instant like heaps of fountains  then brokenly sank in a shower offlakes  leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round themarble trunk of the whale  give way   cried ahab to the oarsmen  and the boats darted forward tothe attack  but maddened by yesterday s fresh irons that corroded inhim  moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fellfrom heaven 
the wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broadwhite forehead  beneath the transparent skin  looked knitted together as head on  he came churning his tail among the boats  and once moreflailed them apart  spilling out the irons and lances from the twomates  boats  and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows but leaving ahab s almost without a scar while daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained planks  and as thewhale swimming out from them  turned  and showed one entire flank as heshot by them again  at that moment a quick cry went up 
lashed roundand round to the fish s back  pinioned in the turns upon turns inwhich  during the past night  the whale had reeled the involutions ofthe lines around him  the half torn body of the parsee was seen  hissable raiment frayed to shreds  his distended eyes turned full upon oldahab the harpoon dropped from his hand  befooled  befooled   drawing in a long lean breath  aye  parsee 
i seethee again  aye  and thou goest before  and this  this then is thehearse that thou didst promise 
but i hold thee to the last letter ofthy word 
where is the second hearse 
away  mates  to the ship 
thoseboats are useless now  repair them if ye can in time  and return to me if not  ahab is enough to die down  men 
the first thing that butoffers to jump from this boat i stand in  that thing i harpoon 
ye arenot other men  but my arms and my legs  and so obey me  where s thewhale 
gone down again  but he looked too nigh the boat  for as if bent upon escaping with thecorpse he bore  and as if the particular place of the last encounterhad been but a stage in his leeward voyage  moby dick was now againsteadily swimming forward  and had almost passed the ship  which thusfar had been sailing in the contrary direction to him  though for thepresent her headway had been stopped 
he seemed swimming with hisutmost velocity  and now only intent upon pursuing his own straightpath in the sea  oh 
ahab   cried starbuck   not too late is it  even now  the thirdday  to desist 
moby dick seeks thee not 
it is thou  thou  thatmadly seekest him  setting sail to the rising wind  the lonely boat was swiftly impelledto leeward  by both oars and canvas 
and at last when ahab was slidingby the vessel  so near as plainly to distinguish starbuck s face as heleaned over the rail  he hailed him to turn the vessel about  andfollow him  not too swiftly  at a judicious interval 
glancing upwards he saw tashtego  queequeg  and daggoo  eagerly mounting to the threemast heads  while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boatswhich had but just been hoisted to the side  and were busily at work inrepairing them 
one after the other  through the port holes  as hesped  he also caught flying glimpses of stubb and flask  busyingthemselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances 
as he saw allthis  as he heard the hammers in the broken boats  far other hammersseemed driving a nail into his heart 
but he rallied 
and now markingthat the vane or flag was gone from the main mast head  he shouted totashtego  who had just gained that perch  to descend again for anotherflag  and a hammer and nails  and so nail it to the mast whether fagged by the three days  running chase  and the resistance tohis swimming in the knotted hamper he bore  or whether it was somelatent deceitfulness and malice in him  whichever was true  the whitewhale s way now began to abate  as it seemed  from the boat so rapidlynearing him once more  though indeed the whale s last start had notbeen so long a one as before 
and still as ahab glided over the wavesthe unpitying sharks accompanied him  and so pertinaciously stuck tothe boat  and so continually bit at the plying oars  that the bladesbecame jagged and crunched  and left small splinters in the sea  atalmost every dip  heed them not 
those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars 
 tis the better rest  the shark s jaw than the yielding water   but at every bite  sir  the thin blades grow smaller and smaller   they will last long enough 
pull on  but who can tell  hemuttered  whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or onahab  but pull on 
aye  all alive  now we near him 
the helm 
take thehelm 
let me pass   and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forwardto the bows of the still flying boat at length as the craft was cast to one side  and ran ranging along withthe white whale s flank  he seemed strangely oblivious of itsadvance as the whale sometimes will and ahab was fairly within thesmoky mountain mist  which  thrown off from the whale s spout  curledround his great  monadnock hump  he was even thus close to him  when with body arched back  and both arms lengthwise high lifted to thepoise  he darted his fierce iron  and his far fiercer curse into thehated whale 
as both steel and curse sank to the socket  as if suckedinto a morass  moby dick sideways writhed  spasmodically rolled hisnigh flank against the bow  and  without staving a hole in it  sosuddenly canted the boat over  that had it not been for the elevatedpart of the gunwale to which he then clung  ahab would once more havebeen tossed into the sea 
as it was  three of the oarsmen who foreknewnot the precise instant of the dart  and were therefore unprepared forits effects these were flung out  but so fell  that  in an instant twoof them clutched the gunwale again  and rising to its level on acombing wave  hurled themselves bodily inboard again  the third manhelplessly dropping astern  but still afloat and swimming almost simultaneously  with a mighty volition of ungraduated instantaneous swiftness  the white whale darted through the welteringsea 
but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns withthe line  and hold it so  and commanded the crew to turn round on theirseats  and tow the boat up to the mark  the moment the treacherous linefelt that double strain and tug  it snapped in the empty air  what breaks in me 
some sinew cracks   tis whole again  oars 
oars burst in upon him  hearing the tremendous rush of the sea crashing boat  the whale wheeledround to present his blank forehead at bay  but in that evolution catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship  seemingly seeingin it the source of all his persecutions  bethinking it it may be alarger and nobler foe  of a sudden  he bore down upon its advancingprow  smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam ahab staggered  his hand smote his forehead 
 i grow blind  hands stretch out before me that i may yet grope my way 
is t night   the whale 
the ship   cried the cringing oarsmen  oars 
slope downwards to thy depths  o sea  that ere it be forever too late  ahab may slide this last  last time upon his mark 
isee  the ship 
the ship 
dash on  my men 
will ye not save my ship  but as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through thesledge hammering seas  the before whale smitten bow ends of two planksburst through  and in an instant almost  the temporarily disabled boatlay nearly level with the waves  its half wading  splashing crew trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water meantime  for that one beholding instant  tashtego s mast head hammerremained suspended in his hand  and the red flag  half wrapping him aswith a plaid  then streamed itself straight out from him  as his ownforward flowing heart  while starbuck and stubb  standing upon thebowsprit beneath  caught sight of the down coming monster just as soonas he  the whale  the whale 
up helm  up helm 
oh  all ye sweet powers ofair  now hug me close 
let not starbuck die  if die he must  in awoman s fainting fit 
up helm  i say ye fools  the jaw 
the jaw 
isthis the end of all my bursting prayers 
all my life long fidelities oh  ahab  ahab  lo  thy work 
helmsman  steady 
nay  nay 
uphelm again 
he turns to meet us 
oh  his unappeasable brow drives ontowards one  whose duty tells him he cannot depart 
my god  stand by menow   stand not by me  but stand under me  whoever you are that will nowhelp stubb  for stubb  too  sticks here 
i grin at thee  thou grinningwhale 
who ever helped stubb  or kept stubb awake  but stubb s ownunwinking eye 
and now poor stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that isall too soft  would it were stuffed with brushwood 
i grin at thee thou grinning whale 
look ye  sun  moon  and stars 
i call ye assassinsof as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost 
for all that  i wouldyet ring glasses with ye  would ye but hand the cup 
oh  oh 
oh  oh thou grinning whale  but there ll be plenty of gulping soon 
why fly yenot  o ahab 
for me  off shoes and jacket to it  let stubb die in hisdrawers 
a most mouldy and over salted death  though  cherries cherries 
oh  flask  for one red cherry ere we die   cherries 
i only wish that we were where they grow 
oh  stubb  i hopemy poor mother s drawn my part pay ere this  if not  few coppers willnow come to her  for the voyage is up  from the ship s bows  nearly all the seamen now hung inactive  hammers bits of plank  lances  and harpoons  mechanically retained in theirhands  just as they had darted from their various employments  alltheir enchanted eyes intent upon the whale  which from side to sidestrangely vibrating his predestinating head  sent a broad band ofoverspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed 
retribution swift vengeance  eternal malice were in his whole aspect  and spite ofall that mortal man could do  the solid white buttress of his foreheadsmote the ship s starboard bow  till men and timbers reeled 
some fellflat upon their faces 
like dislodged trucks  the heads of theharpooneers aloft shook on their bull like necks 
through the breach they heard the waters pour  as mountain torrents down a flume  the ship 
the hearse  the second hearse   cried ahab from the boat  its wood could only be american  diving beneath the settling ship  the whale ran quivering along itskeel  but turning under water  swiftly shot to the surface again  faroff the other bow  but within a few yards of ahab s boat  where  for atime  he lay quiescent  i turn my body from the sun 
what ho  tashtego 
let me hear thyhammer 
ye three unsurrendered spires of mine  thou uncracked keel and only god bullied hull  thou firm deck  and haughty helm  andpole pointed prow  death glorious ship 
must ye then perish  andwithout me 
am i cut off from the last fond pride of meanestshipwrecked captains 
oh  lonely death on lonely life 
oh  now i feelmy topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief 
ho  ho 
from all yourfurthest bounds  pour ye now in  ye bold billows of my whole foregonelife  and top this one piled comber of my death 
towards thee i roll thou all destroying but unconquering whale  to the last i grapple withthee  from hell s heart i stab at thee  for hate s sake i spit my lastbreath at thee 
sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool and since neither can be mine  let me then tow to pieces  while stillchasing thee  though tied to thee  thou damned whale 
thus  i give upthe spear  the harpoon was darted  the stricken whale flew forward  with ignitingvelocity the line ran through the grooves  ran foul 
ahab stooped toclear it  he did clear it  but the flying turn caught him round theneck  and voicelessly as turkish mutes bowstring their victim  he wasshot out of the boat  ere the crew knew he was gone 
next instant  theheavy eye splice in the rope s final end flew out of the stark emptytub  knocked down an oarsman  and smiting the sea  disappeared in itsdepths for an instant  the tranced boat s crew stood still  then turned 
great god  where is the ship   soon they through dim  bewilderingmediums saw her sidelong fading phantom  as in the gaseous fatamorgana  only the uppermost masts out of water  while fixed byinfatuation  or fidelity  or fate  to their once lofty perches  thepagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea and now  concentric circles seized the lone boat itself  and all itscrew  and each floating oar  and every lance pole  and spinning animate and inanimate  all round and round in one vortex  carried thesmallest chip of the pequod out of sight but as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over thesunken head of the indian at the mainmast  leaving a few inches of theerect spar yet visible  together with long streaming yards of the flag which calmly undulated  with ironical coincidings  over the destroyingbillows they almost touched  at that instant  a red arm and a hammerhovered backwardly uplifted in the open air  in the act of nailing theflag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar 
a sky hawk thattauntingly had followed the main truck downwards from its natural homeamong the stars  pecking at the flag  and incommoding tashtego there this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing betweenthe hammer and the wood  and simultaneously feeling that etherialthrill  the submerged savage beneath  in his death gasp  kept hishammer frozen there  and so the bird of heaven  with archangelicshrieks  and his imperial beak thrust upwards  and his whole captiveform folded in the flag of ahab  went down with his ship  which  likesatan  would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part ofheaven along with her  and helmeted herself with it now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf  a sullenwhite surf beat against its steep sides  then all collapsed  and thegreat shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago epilogue and i only am escaped alone to tell thee  job the drama s done 
why then here does any one step forth  because onedid survive the wreck it so chanced  that after the parsee s disappearance  i was he whom thefates ordained to take the place of ahab s bowsman  when that bowsmanassumed the vacant post  the same  who  when on the last day the threemen were tossed from out of the rocking boat  was dropped astern 
so floating on the margin of the ensuing scene  and in full sight of it when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me  i was then  butslowly  drawn towards the closing vortex 
when i reached it  it hadsubsided to a creamy pool 
round and round  then  and ever contractingtowards the button like black bubble at the axis of that slowlywheeling circle  like another ixion i did revolve 
till  gaining thatvital centre  the black bubble upward burst  and now  liberated byreason of its cunning spring  and  owing to its great buoyancy  risingwith great force  the coffin life buoy shot lengthwise from the sea fell over  and floated by my side 
buoyed up by that coffin  for almostone whole day and night  i floated on a soft and dirgelike main 
theunharming sharks  they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths the savage sea hawks sailed with sheathed beaks 
on the second day  asail drew near  nearer  and picked me up at last 
it was thedevious cruising rachel  that in her retracing search after her missingchildren  only found another orphan
